# After Credentials

A few months ago I read a New York Times article on South
Korean cram schools that said 
  Admission to the right university can make or break an ambitious
  young South Korean.
 A parent added: 
  "In our country, college entrance exams determine 70 to 80 percent
  of a person's future."
 It was striking how old fashioned this sounded.  And
yet when I was in high school it wouldn't have seemed too far off
as a description of the US.  Which means things must have been
changing here.

The course of people's lives in the US now seems to be determined
less by credentials and more by performance than it was 25 years
ago.  Where you go to college still matters, but not like it used
to.

What happened?
