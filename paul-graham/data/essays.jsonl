I decided\n\nto find out by making it.Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone\n\nworking in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the\n\nintersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does\n\nhave a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled \"work hard.\"The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.\n\nThe first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose\n\nneeds to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a\n\nnatural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that\n\noffers scope to do great work.In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion.\n\nAmbitious people are if anything already too conservative about it.\n\nSo all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for\n\nand great interest in.\n\n[1]That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When\n\nyou're young you don't know what you're good at or what different\n\nkinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not\n\neven exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at\n\n14, most have to figure it out.The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not\n\nsure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going.\n\nYou'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's\n\ngood to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries\n\ncome from noticing connections between different fields.Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let \"work\"\n\nmean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do\n\ngreat work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.\n\nIt may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your\n\npart of it.What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly\n\nambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves,\n\nexciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly\n\nambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach\n\nyourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered\n\nquestions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the\n\nrudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let\n\nit have its way, will also show you what to work on.What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that\n\nwould bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the\n\nnext step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the\n\nfrontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a\n\ndistance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get\n\nclose to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because\n\nyour brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler\n\nmodel of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions\n\nabout things that everyone else took for granted.\n\n[2]If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often\n\nhas a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math.\n\nIt would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears,\n\nembrace it.Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested\n\nin them — in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited\n\nabout some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have\n\nenough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking,\n\nthat's as good a bet as you'll find.\n\n[3]Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier,\n\nnotice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone\n\nwho's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible\n\nto prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the\n\nempirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.\n\nThat's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply\n\ninterested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere\n\ndiligence ever could.The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the\n\ndesire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and\n\nthat combination is the most powerful of all.The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack\n\nin the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world\n\ninside.Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring\n\nout what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't\n\ntell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which\n\nmeans the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for\n\nyears before you know how much you like it or how good you are at\n\nit. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning\n\nabout, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose\n\nlate based on very incomplete information.\n\n[4]The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in\n\ntwo forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that\n\ngrows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the\n\nmore you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what\n\nto do.The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They\n\nexpect you to commit to a field long before you could know what\n\nit's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal\n\ntrajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted\n\nthat the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what\n\nto work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow\n\nmagically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will:\n\nwhen it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own.\n\nSome people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will\n\nfind themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on\n\nthe assumption that everyone does.What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know\n\nwhat to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively,\n\nassuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action.\n\nBut there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read\n\nbiographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how\n\nmuch luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result\n\nof a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.\n\nSo you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to\n\ndo that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people,\n\nread lots of books, ask lots of questions.\n\n[5]When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you\n\nlearn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very\n\ndifferent from what you do in high school math classes. So you need\n\nto give different types of work a chance to show you what they're\n\nlike. But a field should become increasingly interesting as you\n\nlearn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than\n\nother people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the\n\nbetter. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste\n\nfor work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find\n\nnew things if you're looking where few have looked before.One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like\n\neven the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the\n\ncourse of working on one thing you discover another that's more\n\nexciting, don't be afraid to switch.If you're making something for people, make sure it's something\n\nthey actually want. The best way to do this is to make something\n\nyou yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool\n\nyou want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests,\n\nthis will also get you your initial audience.This should follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most\n\nexciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason\n\nI mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong.\n\nInstead of making what they want, they try to make what some\n\nimaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down\n\nthat route, you're lost.\n\n[6]There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're\n\ntrying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion,\n\nfear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But\n\nif you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof\n\nagainst all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.\n\nFollowing your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy,\n\nbut in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of\n\nobstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it\n\ndoes take a good deal of boldness.But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning.\n\nIn most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard\n\non excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of\n\nit. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try\n\nto preserve certain invariants.The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements\n\nyou can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich\n\nby deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal,\n\nbut you can't discover natural selection that way.I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy\n\nis not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most\n\ninteresting and gives you the best options for the future. I call\n\nthis approach \"staying upwind.\" This is how most people who've done\n\ngreat work seem to have done it.\n\nEven when you've found something exciting to work on, working on\n\nit is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new\n\nidea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to\n\nwork. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't\n\nlike that.You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.\n\nThere are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a\n\ntechnique to working, just as there is to sailing.For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too\n\nhard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns:\n\nfatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health.\n\nThe point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the\n\ntype. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for\n\nfour or five hours a day.Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try\n\nto arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in.\n\nYou'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.\n\nYou'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial\n\nthreshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a\n\nflaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both\n\nper day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the\n\nsense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's\n\nok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over\n\nit.It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great\n\nwork, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't. When I'm\n\nreluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by\n\nsaying \"I'll just read over what I've got so far.\" Five minutes\n\nlater I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and\n\nI'm off.Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie\n\nto yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example.\n\nLots of great things began with someone saying \"How hard could it\n\nbe?\"This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more\n\noptimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism\n\nis ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be\n\nmore work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise\n\nin tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best\n\nwork happens in what was meant to be the final stage.Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what\n\nyou're working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you\n\ndiscover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after\n\nall.\n\n[7]\n\nSince there are two senses of starting work — per day and per\n\nproject — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project\n\nprocrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting\n\nthat ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't\n\nquite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can\n\nget a lot not done.\n\n[8]One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it\n\nusually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around\n\ndoing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So\n\nper-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day\n\nprocrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I\n\nworking on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok\n\nif the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous\n\nas you get older.\n\n[9]\n\nGreat work usually entails spending what would seem to most people\n\nan unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of\n\nthis time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the\n\nwork sufficiently engaging as it's happening.There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years\n\nat things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not\n\nhow great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently\n\non something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take\n\nstock, you're surprised how far you've come.The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative\n\neffect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but\n\nif you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key:\n\nconsistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every\n\nday. They get something done, rather than nothing.If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most\n\npeople who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to\n\nthink about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon:\n\nthe more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more.\n\nGrowing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more\n\nnew fans they'll bring you.The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat\n\nin the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential\n\ncurve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential\n\ngrowth in its early stages.Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's\n\nworth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since\n\nwe underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done\n\nunconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase\n\nof learning something new because they know from experience that\n\nlearning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their\n\naudience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do.\n\nIf people consciously realized they could invest in exponential\n\ngrowth, many more would do it.\n\nWork doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of\n\nundirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying\n\nin bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a\n\nlittle, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by\n\nfrontal attack.You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this\n\nphenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The\n\ndaydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds\n\nit questions.\n\n[10]Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important\n\nto avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your\n\nmind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that\n\nmoment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out\n\nof the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on\n\nthe distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)\n\nConsciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field.\n\nUntil you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't\n\nknow what you're aiming for.And that is what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to\n\nbe the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made\n\nby so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth\n\nthinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a\n\nphenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where\n\nalmost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short.\n\nOr it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively\n\ndifferent thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is\n\nsimply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.\n\n[11]Fortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might\n\nseem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the\n\nbest, in practice you often end up net ahead. It's exciting, and\n\nalso strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it's\n\neasier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will\n\ncare about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter\n\nmore than your contemporaries', but because something that still\n\nseems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.\n\nDon't try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best\n\njob you can; you won't be able to help doing it in a distinctive\n\nway.Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying\n\nto is affectation.Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is\n\ndoing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while\n\nyou're pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows\n\nin the work.\n\n[12]The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They\n\noften feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that\n\nproblem, because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently\n\nambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're\n\nnot a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work and\n\nyour identity will take care of itself.\n\n\"Avoid affectation\" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how\n\nwould you express this idea positively? How would you say what to\n\nbe, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're\n\nearnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar\n\nvices.The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're\n\ntaught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind\n\nof sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new\n\nideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're\n\ntrying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can\n\nyou have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight\n\npositive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing\n\nto admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken\n\nabout something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it.\n\n[13]Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality.\n\nInformality is much more important than its grammatically negative\n\nname implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means\n\nfocusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as\n\ndoing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing\n\nit. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being\n\ngood. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work:\n\nthey expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's\n\nbasically the definition of a nerd.Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need\n\nin doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood.\n\nSo hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than\n\nthe one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms\n\nof them. \"It's easy to criticize\" is true in the most literal sense,\n\nand the route to great work is never easy.There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and\n\npessimistic, but if you want to do great work it's an advantage to\n\nbe optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a\n\nfool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The\n\nOld Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a\n\nfool. But that's advice for seeming smart. If you actually want\n\nto discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling\n\npeople your ideas.Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a\n\nconscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I\n\ndoubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest.\n\nIt's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin\n\nfor error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected,\n\nintellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool.\n\n[14]\n\nGreat work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself.\n\nIt's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle\n\nof working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily\n\nhave to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some\n\neffort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias\n\nand laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat\n\nthis ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert\n\nto what I have now?Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit\n\njust because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of\n\neffort.Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're\n\ndoing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll\n\nunderstand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about\n\nwhether there's anything real there.Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from\n\nthe arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term \"elegant\"\n\napplied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior —\n\nthat the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical\n\nelegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math.Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will\n\noften have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of\n\neffort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people,\n\nat least temporarily.Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively\n\nlittle effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn't\n\nhave to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard\n\nto say whether you're creating something or discovering it.When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or\n\ndiscovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself\n\nas a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem\n\nto work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case\n\nit's more like creating something. In the best case you create the\n\nfield in the process of exploring it.)Similarly, if you're trying to build a powerful tool, make it\n\ngratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition\n\nwill be used in ways you didn't expect, so err on the side of\n\neliminating restrictions, even if you don't know what the benefit\n\nwill be.Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something\n\nothers build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that\n\nothers could use, or exposing questions that others could answer.\n\nThe best ideas have implications in many different areas.If you express your ideas in the most general form, they'll be truer\n\nthan you intended.\n\nTrue by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be\n\ntrue and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new\n\nideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers\n\nof knowledge.In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity,\n\nand imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name,\n\nbecause it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible\n\nto have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great\n\ndeal of what's often called technical ability — and yet not have\n\nmuch of this.I've never liked the term \"creative process.\" It seems misleading.\n\nOriginality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers\n\nthrow off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle\n\ngrinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand\n\nvery well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most\n\noriginal thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got\n\ndivorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15\n\nyear old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see\n\noriginality separated from expertise like that made its nature all\n\nthe more clear.I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there\n\nare definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For\n\nexample, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're\n\nworking on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have\n\noriginal ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something\n\nslightly too difficult.\n\n[15]Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good\n\nway to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a\n\nmissing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you.\n\nIndeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll\n\noften find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often\n\ndislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit.\n\nSometimes it's enough just to go for a walk.\n\n[16]It also helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas\n\nif you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives\n\nthe angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because\n\nanalogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.Don't divide your attention evenly between many topics though,\n\nor you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it\n\naccording to something more like a power law.\n\n[17]\n\nBe professionally\n\ncurious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds\n\noriginality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship\n\nis closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality;\n\nit's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since\n\nquestions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity\n\nat its best is a creative force.\n\nHaving new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of\n\nseeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a\n\nnew idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this\n\nbefore?When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably\n\na good one.Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having\n\nnew ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction?\n\nIt's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the\n\nway you look at the world. We see the world through models that\n\nboth help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas\n\nbecome obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard.\n\nThat's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover:\n\nthey're easy to see after you do something hard.One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other\n\npeople. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where\n\nthey bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these\n\nclues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached\n\nto their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend\n\nto ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous\n\nit may seem in retrospect.To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead\n\nof looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the\n\nwild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was\n\nlooking for new ideas as because he was stricter.The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical\n\nas it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps\n\nto be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the\n\npoint of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially\n\nshares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new\n\nideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem\n\nperfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world\n\nthey brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the\n\ngreater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally\n\naccepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to\n\nmost people, or someone would have already explored it. So what\n\nyou're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of\n\ncrazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often\n\nideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of\n\ncrazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas\n\nideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy\n\nbreaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases\n\nbeing aggressively and passively independent-minded.The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules\n\ndon't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional\n\nenergy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of\n\na project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it\n\nstarted.The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps\n\neven to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often\n\nmake new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts\n\nas a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies\n\nalso seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs.\n\nSeveral I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination.\n\nIn popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken\n\nmodel in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial\n\nones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking are\n\nopposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers\n\ncan be truly strict.\n\nAn overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do\n\nsee it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious\n\nshoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much\n\nwork, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if\n\nyou could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for someone\n\nelse to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to\n\nprotect you.You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other\n\ndirection: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished\n\nbut mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable\n\nideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So\n\nanything that can be described either literally or metaphorically\n\nas a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow.\n\nCopernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.\n\n[18]What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being\n\ntoo attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident\n\nas they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?\n\nPeople show much more originality in solving problems than in\n\ndeciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly\n\nconservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream\n\nof being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on\n\nfashionable problems.One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than\n\nsolutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy\n\nyou for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But\n\neven so I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely\n\nresponding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems\n\nare undervalued.One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the\n\nproblem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't.\n\nGreat work often takes something that already exists and shows its\n\nlatent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're\n\ninterested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let\n\ntheir skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's\n\nno hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied\n\nelsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And\n\nthere's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that\n\nwould otherwise be wasted.But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly\n\nunfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't\n\nseem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these?\n\nBy being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way,\n\nand tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head\n\nthat says you should only be working on \"important\" problems.You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is\n\ntoo conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important\n\nbut overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already\n\non your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you\n\nwere going to take a break from \"serious\" work to work on something\n\njust because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The\n\nanswer is probably more important than it seems.Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than\n\noriginality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people\n\nwho discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the\n\ninitial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key\n\nto the whole game.\n\nFew grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas\n\nis about the ratio of question to answer in their composition.\n\nPeople think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was\n\nin the question.Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used\n\nin schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being\n\nanswered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can\n\nbe much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery.\n\nHow do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to\n\nearth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By\n\neven asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel\n\nterritory.Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around\n\nwith you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of\n\nnoticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing\n\nthat two unanswered questions are the same.Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often\n\ncomes from returning to a question you first noticed years before\n\n— in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about.\n\nPeople talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful\n\ndreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful\n\nquestions alive.\n\n[19]This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from\n\nthe popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are\n\ncertain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long\n\nas (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else\n\nunderstands them either.Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea\n\nis discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled\n\nabout something. Which means that originality consists partly of\n\npuzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with\n\nthe world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them,\n\nbut not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them.\n\n[20]It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is\n\none of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best\n\nway to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones.\n\nQuestions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.\n\nThe best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread\n\nprotruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it\n\njust gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be\n\nobviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict\n\nthat. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to\n\npredict how much will unravel if you pull on it.It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on\n\na lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The\n\ninitial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side\n\nprojects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start\n\nlots of small things.Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try,\n\nthe greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand,\n\nthough, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things\n\nthat don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also\n\nhaving a lot of bad ones.\n\n[21]Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything\n\nthat's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by\n\ntrying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you\n\ndo look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when\n\nstarting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like\n\ntwo puzzle pieces.How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By\n\nmaking successive versions. Great things are almost always made in\n\nsuccessive versions. You start with something small and evolve it,\n\nand the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than\n\nanything you could have planned.It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're\n\nmaking something for people — to get an initial version in front\n\nof them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work.\n\nSurprisingly often, it does. If it doesn't, this will at least get\n\nyou started.Don't try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There\n\nare names for doing this with the first version (taking too long\n\nto ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are\n\nboth merely instances of a more general principle.An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a\n\ntoy. It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has\n\neverything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow.\n\n[22]The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it\n\nis to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does\n\nusually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized\n\nto say \"we're going to do x and then y and then z\" than \"we're going\n\nto try x and see what happens.\" And it is more organized; it just\n\ndoesn't work as well.Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a\n\nnecessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something\n\nyou have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or\n\nbecause you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If\n\nyou keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to\n\nplan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.\n\nTake as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk\n\nis proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a\n\nbet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally,\n\nyou're probably being too conservative.Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the\n\nyoung who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear\n\nrisk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most.Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working\n\non it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and\n\nencountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably\n\nno better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying\n\nto do something slightly too hard.\n\nUse the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages\n\nof age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy,\n\ntime, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge,\n\nefficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of\n\nthe latter when young and keep some of the former when old.The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they\n\nhave. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest\n\nis probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time.\n\nThe best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly\n\nfrivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know\n\nabout, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just\n\nbecause it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.That \"slightly\" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly\n\nwhen you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference\n\nbetween doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing\n\nsomething you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet,\n\nand possibly a better one than you think.\n\n[23]The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience,\n\nis that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain\n\nembraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit\n\ntogether perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but\n\noccasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly\n\nand jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the\n\nidea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not\n\nto.\n\n[24]So when you're learning about something for the first time, pay\n\nattention to things that seem wrong or missing. You'll be tempted\n\nto ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you.\n\nAnd you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep\n\nprogressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further\n\ninto the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If\n\nthey're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they\n\nprobably represent an undiscovered idea.\n\nOne of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience\n\nis to know what you don't have to worry about. The young know all\n\nthe things that could matter, but not their relative importance.\n\nSo they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much\n\nmore about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience.\n\nThe other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at\n\nadulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you've\n\nacquired and false things you've been taught — and you won't be\n\nable to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in\n\nthe way of whatever type of work you want to do.Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools.\n\nWe're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school\n\nas identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of\n\nstrange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child,\n\nthere was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you\n\nwhat you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither\n\nclasses nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts\n\nof the way schools are usually designed.The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still\n\nin school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your\n\nteachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem\n\na stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's\n\nthe truth economically, and in the best case it's the truth\n\nintellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your\n\nbosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source\n\nof advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like.\n\nIn school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost\n\nalways soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In\n\nreal life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you\n\noften don't know if they're soluble at all.But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win\n\nby hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You\n\ncan't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way\n\nto beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others\n\nhave overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.\n\nDon't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you\n\na \"big break.\" Even if this were true, the best way to get it would\n\nbe to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential\n\npeople.And don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that\n\nimpress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different\n\nfrom those required to do great work. The decisions of selection\n\ncommittees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of\n\na feedback loop, and very few are.\n\nPeople new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing\n\ninherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how\n\nsomething works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does\n\ncopying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the\n\npresence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy\n\nsomething, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still,\n\nunconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed\n\nphrase \"Great artists steal.\" The really dangerous kind of copying,\n\nthe kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done\n\nwithout realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train\n\nrunning on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other\n\nextreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.\n\n[25]In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be\n\nin some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a\n\nvacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're\n\nfirst starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're\n\ngoing to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once\n\nyou're established, you can react to your own. But while the former\n\ngets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two\n\ncases are more similar than they seem.Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes\n\nmakes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New\n\ndiscoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of\n\nexisting things, even by their discoverers, because there isn't\n\nyet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that\n\nyou'll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at\n\nthe frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.And when you do copy something, don't copy every feature of it.\n\nSome will make you ridiculous if you do. Don't copy the manner of\n\nan eminent 50 year old professor if you're 18, for example, or the\n\nidiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded\n\ndespite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the\n\nmost likely to be the flaws.This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are\n\njerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that\n\nbeing a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented\n\nis merely how they get away with it.One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from\n\none field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries\n\nof this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by\n\ndeliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas\n\nfrom quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you\n\ncan sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things\n\ndone well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's\n\nmissing.\n\nIf a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one\n\nplace, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will\n\nincrease your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people\n\nare human, increase your self-confidence.\n\n[26]If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you\n\nmight expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy\n\nto talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're\n\nreally good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's\n\ninterest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their\n\nhobbies.It may take some effort to find the people who are really good,\n\nthough. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places,\n\nparticularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone\n\nis engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities\n\ncan't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in\n\ndifferent departments varies immensely. Some departments have people\n\ndoing great work; others have in the past; others never have.\n\nSeek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't\n\nbe done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's\n\ngood to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect\n\nyou. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better\n\nto have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good\n\nones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from\n\nhistory: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests\n\nthat one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great\n\nwork and not.How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my\n\nexperience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure,\n\nyou probably don't. But it may be possible to give a more concrete\n\nanswer than that. Here's an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues\n\noffer surprising insights. They can see and do things that you\n\ncan't. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep\n\nyou on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some\n\nprojects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those\n\nis not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you'll\n\nhave to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and\n\ninterest like any other kind of work. If you don't have them, there\n\nis no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management\n\nas a second language, or avoid such projects.\n\n[27]\n\nHusband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working\n\non ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a\n\nliving organism.Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great\n\nwork if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of\n\nyourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If\n\nyou choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a\n\nrefuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism,\n\nit's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by\n\nsome of the greatest minds in history.Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which\n\nincreases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this\n\ncycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing\n\ngood work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since\n\nit matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right\n\ndirection, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when\n\nyou're stuck, just so you start to get something done.One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow\n\nsetbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.\n\nYou can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering\n\nsetbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always\n\ninvolves some backtracking.Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the\n\ndesire to. So \"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again\" isn't\n\nquite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either\n\ntry again, or backtrack and then try again.\"Never give up\" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times\n\nwhen it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would\n\nbe: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you\n\nneed to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more\n\nthan it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends\n\nhow fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from\n\nbad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.\n\nAn audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar,\n\nyour audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience\n\nin the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big.\n\nThe value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with\n\nits size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if\n\nyou're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated\n\naudience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people\n\ngenuinely love what you're doing, that's enough.To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between\n\nyou and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable,\n\nbut it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off\n\nswitching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.\n\n[28]The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your\n\nmorale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and\n\nothers who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always\n\nwhat you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and\n\navoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there's someone\n\nyou need to take care of, that takes precedence.Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work,\n\nor sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're\n\nambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition;\n\nso someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you,\n\nor does and doesn't care.Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's\n\nimportant to take care of it. That means exercising regularly,\n\neating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of\n\ndrugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise\n\nbecause they're good for thinking.\n\n[29]People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone\n\nelse, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. In fact,\n\nif you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous not to be productive.\n\nPeople who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to\n\nbecome bitter.\n\nIt's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people.\n\nThe opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the\n\nopinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just\n\nadds noise.The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and\n\nsometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough,\n\nyou'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of\n\nwork is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose\n\nthe problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing\n\nsomething just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors\n\nmake you do anything much more specific than work harder.Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows\n\nmore than you do about what's worth paying attention to.\n\nNotice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the\n\nsecret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single\n\nword, my bet would be on \"curiosity.\"That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to\n\nbe curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can\n\nnurture it and let it drive you.Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will\n\nchoose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to\n\nnotice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole\n\nprocess is a kind of dance with curiosity.\n\nBelieve it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could.\n\nBut its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it\n\nthis far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so\n\nyou're already further along than you might realize, because the\n\nset of people willing to want to is small.The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal,\n\nmathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and\n\nluck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can\n\nignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to\n\ndo great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest.\n\nCan you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will\n\ncombine to yield an explosion of new ideas?Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different\n\nways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered.\n\nOut of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited\n\nfor is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close\n\nmatch. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your\n\nability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by\n\ntrying.Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds\n\nthem back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous\n\nto try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if\n\nyou tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation\n\nis rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do\n\ngreat work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy\n\naway from the question.So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great\n\nwork, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that.\n\nI wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know\n\nyou're interested.Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone.\n\nAnd if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have\n\nworse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst\n\nproblem you have.Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to\n\nwork hard. And if you're working on something you find very\n\ninteresting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path,\n\nthe work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your\n\npeers'.The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?\n\nNotes[1]\n\nI don't think you could give a precise definition of what\n\ncounts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important\n\nso well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But\n\nthere's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree, and\n\noften hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused\n\non developing their interests rather than worrying about whether\n\nthey're important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and\n\nleave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.[2]\n\nA lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in\n\neveryday life. \"Did you ever notice...?\" New ideas come from doing\n\nthis about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people's\n\nreaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha![3]\n\nThat second qualifier is critical. If you're excited about\n\nsomething most authorities discount, but you can't give a more\n\nprecise explanation than \"they don't get it,\" then you're starting\n\nto drift into the territory of cranks.[4]\n\nFinding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding\n\na match between the current version of you and a list of known\n\nproblems. You'll often have to coevolve with the problem. That's\n\nwhy it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The\n\nsearch space is huge. It's the cartesian product of all possible\n\ntypes of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible\n\nfuture versions of you.There's no way you could search this whole space, so you have to\n\nrely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope\n\nthe best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be;\n\ndifferent types of work have been collected together as much by\n\naccidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.[5]\n\nThere are many reasons curious people are more likely to do\n\ngreat work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide\n\nnet, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in the\n\nfirst place.[6]\n\nIt can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you\n\nfeel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk\n\ndown to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it\n\nin a sufficiently cynical way, but it's not the route to great work.\n\nNot that anyone using this m.o. would care.[7]\n\nThis idea I learned from Hardy's A Mathematician's Apology,\n\nwhich I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any\n\nfield.[8]\n\nJust as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate\n\nwhat we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done\n\nby procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by\n\nprocrastinating for several years.[9]\n\nYou can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want,\n\nespecially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work\n\nclose to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for\n\ndoing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side.\n\nBoth can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your\n\nwork is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight\n\nto get time to do it.[10]\n\nIf you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax\n\ncycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and\n\nthat you walk to and from.[11]\n\nThere may be some very unworldly people who do great work\n\nwithout consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to\n\ncover that case, it becomes: Don't try to be anything except the\n\nbest.[12]\n\nThis gets more complicated in work like acting, where the\n\ngoal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it's possible to be\n\naffected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid\n\nunintentional affectation.[13]\n\nIt's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable\n\nif and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe\n\nto have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under\n\nthe law, because a sentence with a \"should\" in it isn't really a\n\nstatement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And\n\nif there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles,\n\nthere can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve\n\nit.[14]\n\nAffectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty.\n\nAffectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in\n\ntime, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.[15]\n\nObviously you don't have to be working at the exact moment\n\nyou have the idea, but you'll probably have been working fairly\n\nrecently.[16]\n\nSome say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I'm\n\nskeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.[17]\n\nFor example you might give the nth most important topic\n\n(m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m > 1. You couldn't allocate\n\nyour attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an\n\nidea of a reasonable distribution.[18]\n\nThe principles defining a religion have to be mistaken.\n\nOtherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to\n\ndistinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.[19]\n\nIt might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of\n\nquestions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you're\n\nnow in a position to do something about some of them.[20]\n\nThe connection between originality and uncertainty causes a\n\nstrange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain\n\nthan the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand\n\nin disputes, even though they're generally stupider.\n\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\n\nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\n[21]\n\nDerived from Linus Pauling's \"If you want to have good ideas,\n\nyou must have many ideas.\"[22]\n\nAttacking a project as a \"toy\" is similar to attacking a\n\nstatement as \"inappropriate.\" It means that no more substantial\n\ncriticism can be made to stick.[23]\n\nOne way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if\n\nyou're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely\n\nto be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where\n\nyou create something is less likely to be a waste of time than\n\nplaying games where you don't.[24]\n\nAnother related advantage is that if you haven't said anything\n\npublicly yet, you won't be biased toward evidence that supports\n\nyour earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve\n\neternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people,\n\nhaving previously published opinions has an effect similar to\n\nideology, just in quantity 1.[25]\n\nIn the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta\n\nMaria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted\n\nhis own version to show how much better he was.[26]\n\nI'm being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of\n\nthis writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that\n\nare hard to duplicate, but that could change.[27]\n\nThis is false when the work the other people have to do is\n\nvery constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible\n\nto expand the area in which it's false by defining similarly\n\nrestricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.[28]\n\nCorollary: Building something that enables people to go around\n\nintermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably\n\na good idea.[29]\n\nIt may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because\n\nthat frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and\n\nthere is some historical evidence for it.Thanks\n\nto Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Pam Graham, Tom Howard,\n\nPatrick Hsu, Steve Huffman, Jessica Livingston, Henry Lloyd-Baker,\n\nBob Metcalfe, Ben Miller, Robert Morris, Michael Nielsen, Courtenay\n\nPipkin, Joris Poort, Mieke Roos, Rajat Suri, Harj Taggar, Garry\n\nTan, and my younger son for suggestions and for reading drafts.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 11619, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:18.548509Z"}
{"id": "kids", "title": "Having Kids", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/kids.html", "date": null, "content": "December 2019Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I\n\nfelt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living\n\nvirtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children.\n\nBut did I want them now? No.If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since\n\nI was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had\n\nno fun.  And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that,\n\nto be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind.\n\nWhenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be\n\nterrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they\n\nprevailed.When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically,\n\nbecause that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at\n\nall.  \"Better you than me,\" I was thinking.Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and\n\nI mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded\n\nturned out to be wonderful.Partly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical\n\nchanges that happened almost instantly when our first child was\n\nborn.  It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt\n\nprotective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was\n\ndriving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a\n\ncrosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking \"I have\n\nto be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is\n\nsomeone's child!\"So to some extent you can't trust me when I say having kids is\n\ngreat.  To some extent I'm like a religious cultist telling you\n\nthat you'll be happy if you join the cult too  but only because\n\njoining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you\n\nhappy to be a cult member.But not entirely. There were some things\n\nabout having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my\n\nobservations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed\n\nthat I wrote \"Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids.\" Of course\n\nthe times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only\n\nnoticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed\n\nthem?  Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only\n\ntimes I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes.\n\nWhich is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler\n\nis something very few parents enjoy.What I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were\n\nall the great moments parents had with kids. People don't talk about\n\nthese much  the magic is hard to put into words, and all other\n\nparents know about them anyway  but one of the great things about\n\nhaving kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is\n\nnowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be\n\ndoing.  You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just\n\nbe going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing\n\nthem on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments\n\nfor anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but\n\nthat's what you feel.  You don't need to look any\n\nfurther than where you are right now.Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they\n\nwere rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that\n\nwas similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble\n\nfor something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was\n\nessentially law enforcement.  I didn't realize there were good times\n\ntoo.I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd\n\nreally enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this\n\nwoman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected\n\nher to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling\n\nthe truth.She said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been\n\ninteresting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids.\n\nYou don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're\n\nreally interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously\n\nfond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty\n\ntimes) it's often genuinely fun to play with them.  That surprised\n\nme too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely\n\nnot fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it\n\ndoes.There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still,\n\nterror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience\n\nthat are hard to imagine unless you've had them. But it is not, as I\n\nimplicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for\n\nthe lifeboats.Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They\n\ndefinitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some\n\npeople get their act together, but if your act was already together,\n\nyou're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're\n\ngoing to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules.  I'm not\n\nsure if it's because that's how kids are, or because it's the only\n\nway to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids,\n\nyou tend to have to work on their schedule.You will have chunks of time to work. But you can't let work spill\n\npromiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had\n\nkids. You're going to have to work at the same time every day,\n\nwhether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be\n\ntimes when you have to stop, even if it is.I've been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds\n\na way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens\n\nat those times. So while I don't get as much done as before I had\n\nkids, I get enough done.I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part\n\nof my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It\n\nhurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But\n\nif there weren't something real there, why would I squirm?  The\n\nfact is, once you have kids, you're probably going to care more\n\nabout them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum\n\ngame. Only one idea at a time can be the\n\ntop idea in your mind.\n\nOnce you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it\n\nwill less often be some project you're working on.I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when\n\nI write essays, I think about what I'd want my kids to know. That\n\ndrives me to get things right. And when I was writing\n\nBel, I told\n\nmy kids that once I finished it I'd take them to Africa. When you\n\nsay that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise.\n\nWhich meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to\n\nAfrica.  Maybe if I'm really lucky such tricks could put me net\n\nahead. But the wind is there, no question.On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it\n\nwon't survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn't\n\noverwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like\n\nbefore. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the\n\nability to take off for some other country at a moment's notice.\n\nThat was so great. Why did I never do that?See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before\n\nkids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used\n\nit.I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up\n\nhappy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments,\n\nthere are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it\n\non tap, almost any bedtime.People's experiences as parents\n\nvary a lot, and I know I've been lucky. But I think the worries I\n\nhad before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other\n\nparents' faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that\n\nkids bring.\n\nNote[1] Adults are sophisticated enough to see 2 year olds for the\n\nfascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 year\n\nolds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris\n\nfor reading drafts of this.Arabic TranslationSlovak Translation", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1512, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:19.156590Z"}
{"id": "selfindulgence", "title": "How to Lose Time and Money", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html", "date": null, "content": "July 2010When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money.  I\n\nnow had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before:\n\nhow not to lose it.   I knew it was possible to go from rich to\n\npoor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.  But while\n\nI'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from\n\npoor to rich,\n\nI knew practically nothing about the paths from rich\n\nto poor.  Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they\n\nwere.So I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost.  If you'd\n\nasked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by\n\nspending all their money.  That's how it happens in books and movies,\n\nbecause that's the colorful way to do it.  But in fact the way most\n\nfortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through\n\nbad investments.It's hard to spend a fortune without noticing.  Someone with ordinary\n\ntastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of\n\nthousands of dollars without thinking \"wow, I'm spending a lot of\n\nmoney.\"  Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a\n\nmillion dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an\n\neye.In most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms\n\nthat making investments doesn't.  Luxuries seem self-indulgent.\n\nAnd unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery,\n\nyou've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads\n\nto trouble.  Investing bypasses those alarms.  You're not spending\n\nthe money; you're just moving it from one asset to another.  Which\n\nis why people trying to sell you expensive things say \"it's an\n\ninvestment.\"The solution is to develop new alarms.  This can be a tricky business,\n\nbecause while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so\n\nbasic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you\n\nfrom making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes\n\nfairly counterintuitive.A few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with\n\ntime is much the same as with money.  The most dangerous way to\n\nlose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake\n\nwork.  When you spend time having fun, you know you're being\n\nself-indulgent.  Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.  If I woke\n\nup one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd\n\nfeel like something was terribly wrong.  Just thinking about it\n\nmakes me wince.  I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on\n\na sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in\n\nfront of a TV all day — days at the end of which, if I asked myself\n\nwhat I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically,\n\nnothing.  I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad\n\nas I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV.  If\n\nI spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into\n\nperdition.  But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get\n\nnothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially,\n\nlike real work.  Dealing with email, for example.  You do it sitting\n\nat a desk.  It's not fun.  So it must be work.With time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to\n\nprotect you.  It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers,\n\nand perhaps all pre-industrial societies.  So nature and nurture\n\ncombine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten\n\nmore complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors\n\nthat bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more\n\nvirtuous types.  And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 652, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:19.759535Z"}
{"id": "field", "title": "The Shape of the Essay Field", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/field.html", "date": null, "content": "June 2025An essay has to tell people something they don't already know. But\n\nthere are three different reasons people might not know something,\n\nand they yield three very different kinds of essays.One reason people won't know something is if it's not important to\n\nknow. That doesn't mean it will make a bad essay. For example, you\n\nmight write a good essay about a particular model of car. Readers\n\nwould learn something from it. It would add to their picture of the\n\nworld. For a handful of readers it might even spur some kind of\n\nepiphany. But unless this is a very unusual car it's not critical\n\nfor everyone to know about it.\n\n[1]If something isn't important to know, there's no answer to the\n\nquestion of why people don't know it. Not knowing random facts is\n\nthe default. But if you're going to write about things that are\n\nimportant to know, you have to ask why your readers don't already\n\nknow them. Is it because they're smart but inexperienced, or because\n\nthey're obtuse?So the three reasons readers might not already know what you tell\n\nthem are (a) that it's not important, (b) that they're obtuse,\n\nor (c) that they're inexperienced.The reason I did this breakdown was to get at the following fact,\n\nwhich might have seemed controversial if I'd led with it, but should\n\nbe obvious now. If you're writing for smart people about important\n\nthings, you're writing for the young.Or more precisely, that's where you'll have the most effect. Whatever\n\nyou say should also be at least somewhat novel to you, however old\n\nyou are. It's not an essay otherwise, because an essay is something\n\nyou write to figure something out. But whatever you figure out will\n\npresumably be more of a surprise to younger readers than it is to\n\nyou.There's a continuum of surprise. At one extreme, something you read\n\ncan change your whole way of thinking. The Selfish Gene did this\n\nto me. It was like suddenly seeing the other interpretation of an\n\nambiguous image: you can treat genes rather than organisms as the\n\nprotagonists, and evolution becomes easier to understand when you\n\ndo. At the other extreme, writing merely puts into words something\n\nreaders were already thinking — or thought they were.The impact of an essay is how much it changes readers' thinking\n\nmultiplied by the importance of the topic. But it's hard to do well\n\nat both. It's hard to have big new ideas about important topics.\n\nSo in practice there's a tradeoff: you can change readers' thinking\n\na lot about moderately important things, or change it a little about\n\nvery important ones. But with younger readers the tradeoff shifts.\n\nThere's more room to change their thinking, so there's a bigger\n\npayoff for writing about important things.The tradeoff isn't a conscious one, at least not for me. It's more\n\nlike a kind of gravitational field that writers work in. But every\n\nessayist works in it, whether they realize it or not.This seems obvious once you state it, but it took me a long time\n\nto understand. I knew I wanted to write for smart people about\n\nimportant topics. I noticed empirically that I seemed to be writing\n\nfor the young. But it took me years to understand that the latter\n\nwas an automatic consequence of the former. In fact I only really\n\nfigured it out as I was writing this essay.Now that I know it, should I change anything? I don't think so. In\n\nfact seeing the shape of the field that writers work in has reminded\n\nme that I'm not optimizing for returns in it. I'm not trying to\n\nsurprise readers of any particular age; I'm trying to surprise\n\nmyself.The way I usually decide what to write about is by following\n\ncuriosity. I notice something new and dig into it. It would probably\n\nbe a mistake to change that. But seeing the shape of the essay field\n\nhas set me thinking. What would surprise young readers? Which\n\nimportant things do people tend to learn late? Interesting question.\n\nI should think about that.\n\nNote[1]\n\nIt's hard to write a really good essay about an unimportant\n\ntopic, though, because a really good essayist will inevitably draw\n\nthe topic into deeper waters. E. B. White could write an essay about\n\nhow to boil potatoes that ended up being full of timeless wisdom.\n\nIn which case, of course, it wouldn't really be about how to boil\n\npotatoes; that would just have been the starting point.Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Michael\n\nNielsen for reading drafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 757, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:20.364931Z"}
{"id": "goodwriting", "title": "Good Writing", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/goodwriting.html", "date": null, "content": "May 2025There are two senses in which writing can be good: it can\n\nsound good, and the ideas can be right. It can have nice,\n\nflowing sentences, and it can draw correct conclusions\n\nabout important things. It might seem as if these two\n\nkinds of good would be unrelated, like the speed of a car\n\nand the color it's painted. And yet I don't think they\n\nare. I think writing that sounds good is more likely to\n\nbe right.So here we have the most exciting kind of idea: one that\n\nseems both preposterous and true. Let's examine it. How\n\ncan this possibly be true?I know it's true from writing. You can't simultaneously\n\noptimize two unrelated things; when you push one far\n\nenough, you always end up sacrificing the other. And yet\n\nno matter how hard I push, I never find myself having to\n\nchoose between the sentence that sounds best and the one\n\nthat expresses an idea best. If I did, it would be\n\nfrivolous to care how sentences sound. But in practice it\n\nfeels the opposite of frivolous. Fixing sentences that\n\nsound bad seems to help get the ideas right.\n\n[1]By right I mean more than just true. Getting the ideas\n\nright means developing them well — drawing the\n\nconclusions that matter most, and exploring each one to\n\nthe right level of detail. So getting the ideas right is\n\nnot just a matter of saying true things, but saying the\n\nright true things.How could trying to make sentences sound good help you do\n\nthat? The clue to the answer is something I noticed 30\n\nyears ago when I was doing the layout for my first book.\n\nSometimes when you're laying out text you have bad luck.\n\nFor example, you get a section that runs one line longer\n\nthan the page. I don't know what ordinary typesetters do\n\nin this situation, but what I did was rewrite the section\n\nto make it a line shorter. You'd expect such an arbitrary\n\nconstraint to make the writing worse. But I found, to my\n\nsurprise, that it never did. I always ended up with\n\nsomething I liked better.I don't think this was because my writing was especially\n\ncareless. I think if you pointed to a random paragraph in\n\nanything written by anyone and told them to make it\n\nslightly shorter (or longer), they'd probably be able to\n\ncome up with something better.The best analogy for this phenomenon is when you shake a\n\nbin full of different objects. The shakes are arbitrary\n\nmotions. Or more precisely, they're not calculated to\n\nmake any two specific objects fit more closely together.\n\nAnd yet repeated shaking inevitably makes the objects\n\ndiscover brilliantly clever ways of packing themselves.\n\nGravity won't let them become less tightly packed, so any\n\nchange has to be a change for the better.\n\n[2]So it is with writing. If you have to rewrite an awkward\n\npassage, you'll never do it in a way that makes it less\n\ntrue. You couldn't bear it, any more than gravity could\n\nbear things floating upward. So any change in the ideas\n\nhas to be a change for the better.It's obvious once you think about it. Writing that sounds\n\ngood is more likely to be right for the same reason that\n\na well-shaken bin is more likely to be tightly packed.\n\nBut there's something else going on as well. Sounding\n\ngood isn't just a random external force that leaves the\n\nideas in an essay better off. It actually helps you to\n\nget them right.The reason is that it makes the essay easier to read.\n\nIt's less work to read writing that flows well. How does\n\nthat help the writer? Because the writer is the first\n\nreader. When I'm working on an essay, I spend far more\n\ntime reading than writing. I'll reread some parts 50 or\n\n100 times, replaying the thoughts in them and asking\n\nmyself, like someone sanding a piece of wood, does\n\nanything catch? Does anything feel wrong? And the easier\n\nthe essay is to read, the easier it is to notice if\n\nsomething catches.So yes, the two senses of good writing are connected in\n\nat least two ways. Trying to make writing sound good\n\nmakes you fix mistakes unconsciously, and also helps you\n\nfix them consciously; it shakes the bin of ideas, and\n\nalso makes mistakes easier to see. But now that we've\n\ndissolved one layer of preposterousness, I can't resist\n\nadding another. Does sounding good do more than just help\n\nyou get the ideas right? Is writing that sounds good\n\ninherently more likely to be right? Crazy as it may\n\nseem, I think that's true too.Obviously there's a connection at the level of individual\n\nwords. There are lots of words in English that sound like\n\nwhat they mean, often in wonderfully subtle ways.\n\nGlitter. Round. Scrape. Prim. Cavalcade. But the sound of\n\ngood writing depends even more on the way you put words\n\ntogether, and there's a connection at that level too.When writing sounds good, it's mostly because it has good\n\nrhythm. But the rhythm of good writing is not the rhythm\n\nof music, or the meter of verse. It's not so regular. If\n\nit were, it wouldn't be good, because the rhythm of good\n\nwriting has to match the ideas in it, and ideas have all\n\nkinds of different shapes. Sometimes they're simple and\n\nyou just state them. But other times they're more subtle,\n\nand you need longer, more complicated sentences to tease\n\nout all the implications.An essay is a cleaned up train of thought, in the same\n\nway dialogue is cleaned up conversation, and a train of\n\nthought has a natural rhythm. So when an essay sounds\n\ngood, it's not merely because it has a pleasing rhythm,\n\nbut because it has its natural one. Which means you can\n\nuse getting the rhythm right as a heuristic for getting\n\nthe ideas right. And not just in principle: good writers\n\ndo both simultaneously as a matter of course. Often I\n\ndon't even distinguish between the two problems. I just\n\nthink Ugh, this doesn't sound right; what do I mean to\n\nsay here?\n\n[3]The sound of writing turns out to be more like the shape\n\nof a plane than the color of a car. If it looks good, as\n\nKelly Johnson used to say, it will fly well.This is only true of writing that's used to develop\n\nideas, though. It doesn't apply when you have ideas in\n\nsome other way and then write about them afterward — for\n\nexample, if you build something, or conduct an\n\nexperiment, and then write a paper about it. In such\n\ncases the ideas often live more in the work than the\n\nwriting, so the writing can be bad even though the ideas\n\nare good. The writing in textbooks and popular surveys\n\ncan be bad for the same reason: the author isn't\n\ndeveloping the ideas, merely describing other people's.\n\nIt's only when you're writing to develop ideas that\n\nthere's such a close connection between the two senses of\n\ndoing it well.Ok, many people will be thinking, this seems plausible so\n\nfar, but what about liars? Is it not notoriously possible\n\nfor a smooth-tongued liar to write something beautiful\n\nthat's completely false?It is, of course. But not without method acting. The way\n\nto write something beautiful and false is to begin by\n\nmaking yourself almost believe it. So just like someone\n\nwriting something beautiful and true, you're presenting a\n\nperfectly-formed train of thought. The difference is the\n\npoint where it attaches to the world. You're saying\n\nsomething that would be true if certain false premises\n\nwere. If for some bizarre reason the number of jobs in a\n\ncountry were fixed, then immigrants really would be\n\ntaking our jobs.So it's not quite right to say that better sounding\n\nwriting is more likely to be true. Better sounding\n\nwriting is more likely to be internally consistent. If\n\nthe writer is honest, internal consistency and truth\n\nconverge.But while we can't safely conclude that beautiful writing\n\nis true, it's usually safe to conclude the converse:\n\nsomething that seems clumsily written will usually have\n\ngotten the ideas wrong too.Indeed, the two senses of good writing are more like two\n\nends of the same thing. The connection between them is\n\nnot a rigid one; the goodness of good writing is not a\n\nrod but a rope, with multiple overlapping connections\n\nrunning through it. But it's hard to move one end without\n\nmoving the other. It's hard to be right without sounding\n\nright.\n\nNotes[1]\n\nThe closest thing to an exception is when you have\n\nto go back and insert a new point into the middle of\n\nsomething you've written. This often messes up the flow,\n\nsometimes in ways you can never quite repair. But I think\n\nthe ultimate source of this problem is that ideas are\n\ntree-shaped and essays are linear. You inevitably run\n\ninto difficulties when you try to cram the former into\n\nthe latter. Frankly it's surprising how much you can get\n\naway with. But even so you sometimes have to resort to an\n\nendnote.[2]\n\nObviously if you shake the bin hard enough the\n\nobjects in it can become less tightly packed. And\n\nsimilarly, if you imposed some huge external constraint\n\non your writing, like using alternating one and two\n\nsyllable words, the ideas would start to suffer.[3]\n\nBizarrely enough, this happened in the writing of\n\nthis very paragraph. An earlier version shared several\n\nphrases in common with the preceding paragraph, and the\n\nrepetition bugged me each time I reread it. When I got\n\nannoyed enough to fix it, I discovered that the\n\nrepetition reflected a problem in the underlying ideas,\n\nand I fixed both simultaneously.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1609, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:20.951664Z"}
{"id": "do", "title": "What to Do", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/do.html", "date": null, "content": "March 2025What should one do? That may seem a strange question, but it's not\n\nmeaningless or unanswerable. It's the sort of question kids ask\n\nbefore they learn not to ask big questions. I only came across it\n\nmyself in the process of investigating something else. But once I\n\ndid, I thought I should at least try to answer it.So what should one do? One should help people, and take care of\n\nthe world. Those two are obvious. But is there anything else? When\n\nI ask that, the answer that pops up is Make good new things.I can't prove that one should do this, any more than I can prove\n\nthat one should help people or take care of the world. We're talking\n\nabout first principles here. But I can explain why this principle\n\nmakes sense. The most impressive thing humans can do is to think.\n\nIt may be the most impressive thing that can be done. And the best\n\nkind of thinking, or more precisely the best proof that one has\n\nthought well, is to make good new things.I mean new things in a very general sense. Newton's physics was a\n\ngood new thing. Indeed, the first version of this principle was to\n\nhave good new ideas. But that didn't seem general enough: it didn't\n\ninclude making art or music, for example, except insofar as they\n\nembody new ideas. And while they may embody new ideas, that's not\n\nall they embody, unless you stretch the word \"idea\" so uselessly\n\nthin that it includes everything that goes through your nervous\n\nsystem.Even for ideas that one has consciously, though, I prefer the\n\nphrasing \"make good new things.\" There are other ways to describe\n\nthe best kind of thinking. To make discoveries, for example, or to\n\nunderstand something more deeply than others have. But how well do\n\nyou understand something if you can't make a model of it, or write\n\nabout it? Indeed, trying to express what you understand is not just\n\na way to prove that you understand it, but a way to understand it\n\nbetter.Another reason I like this phrasing is that it biases us toward\n\ncreation. It causes us to prefer the kind of ideas that are naturally\n\nseen as making things rather than, say, making critical observations\n\nabout things other people have made. Those are ideas too, and\n\nsometimes valuable ones, but it's easy to trick oneself into believing\n\nthey're more valuable than they are. Criticism seems sophisticated,\n\nand making new things often seems awkward, especially at first; and\n\nyet it's precisely those first steps that are most rare and valuable.Is newness essential? I think so. Obviously it's essential in\n\nscience. If you copied a paper of someone else's and published it\n\nas your own, it would seem not merely unimpressive but dishonest.\n\nAnd it's similar in the arts. A copy of a good painting can be a\n\npleasing thing, but it's not impressive in the way the original\n\nwas. Which in turn implies it's not impressive to make the same\n\nthing over and over, however well; you're just copying yourself.Note though that we're talking about a different kind of should\n\nwith this principle. Taking care of people and the world are shoulds\n\nin the sense that they're one's duty, but making good new things\n\nis a should in the sense that this is how to live to one's full\n\npotential. Historically most rules about how to live have been a\n\nmix of both kinds of should, though usually with more of the former\n\nthan the latter.\n\n[1]For most of history the question \"What should one do?\" got much the\n\nsame answer everywhere, whether you asked Cicero or Confucius. You\n\nshould be wise, brave, honest, temperate, and just, uphold tradition,\n\nand serve the public interest. There was a long stretch where in\n\nsome parts of the world the answer became \"Serve God,\" but in\n\npractice it was still considered good to be wise, brave, honest,\n\ntemperate, and just, uphold tradition, and serve the public interest.\n\nAnd indeed this recipe would have seemed right to most Victorians.\n\nBut there's nothing in it about taking care of the world or making\n\nnew things, and that's a bit worrying, because it seems like this\n\nquestion should be a timeless one. The answer shouldn't change much.I'm not too worried that the traditional answers don't mention\n\ntaking care of the world. Obviously people only started to care\n\nabout that once it became clear we could ruin it. But how can making\n\ngood new things be important if the traditional answers don't mention\n\nit?The traditional answers were answers to a slightly different question.\n\nThey were answers to the question of how to be, rather than what\n\nto do. The audience didn't have a lot of choice about what to do.\n\nThe audience up till recent centuries was the landowning class,\n\nwhich was also the political class. They weren't choosing between\n\ndoing physics and writing novels. Their work was foreordained:\n\nmanage their estates, participate in politics, fight when necessary.\n\nIt was ok to do certain other kinds of work in one's spare time,\n\nbut ideally one didn't have any. Cicero's De Officiis is one of the\n\ngreat classical answers to the question of how to live, and in it\n\nhe explicitly says that he wouldn't even be writing it if he hadn't\n\nbeen excluded from public life by recent political upheavals.\n\n[2]There were of course people doing what we would now call \"original\n\nwork,\" and they were often admired for it, but they weren't seen\n\nas models. Archimedes knew that he was the first to prove that a\n\nsphere has 2/3 the volume of the smallest enclosing cylinder and\n\nwas very pleased about it. But you don't find ancient writers urging\n\ntheir readers to emulate him. They regarded him more as a prodigy\n\nthan a model.Now many more of us can follow Archimedes's example and devote most\n\nof our attention to one kind of work. He turned out to be a model\n\nafter all, along with a collection of other people that his\n\ncontemporaries would have found it strange to treat as a distinct\n\ngroup, because the vein of people making new things ran at right\n\nangles to the social hierarchy.What kinds of new things count? I'd rather leave that question to\n\nthe makers of them. It would be a risky business to try to define\n\nany kind of threshold, because new kinds of work are often despised\n\nat first. Raymond Chandler was writing literal pulp fiction, and\n\nhe's now recognized as one of the best writers of the twentieth\n\ncentury. Indeed this pattern is so common that you can use it as a\n\nrecipe: if you're excited about some kind of work that's not\n\nconsidered prestigious and you can explain what everyone else is\n\noverlooking about it, then this is not merely a kind of work that's\n\nok to do, but one to seek out.The other reason I wouldn't want to define any thresholds is that\n\nwe don't need them. The kind of people who make good new things\n\ndon't need rules to keep them honest.So there's my guess at a set of principles to live by: take care\n\nof people and the world, and make good new things. Different people\n\nwill do these to varying degrees. There will presumably be lots who\n\nfocus entirely on taking care of people. There will be a few who\n\nfocus mostly on making new things. But even if you're one of those,\n\nyou should at least make sure that the new things you make don't\n\nnet harm people or the world. And if you go a step further and\n\ntry to make things that help them, you may find you're ahead on the\n\ntrade. You'll be more constrained in what you can make, but you'll\n\nmake it with more energy.On the other hand, if you make something amazing, you'll often be\n\nhelping people or the world even if you didn't mean to. Newton was\n\ndriven by curiosity and ambition, not by any practical effect his\n\nwork might have, and yet the practical effect of his work has been\n\nenormous. And this seems the rule rather than the exception. So\n\nif you think you can make something amazing, you should probably\n\njust go ahead and do it.Notes[1]\n\nWe could treat all three as the same kind of should by saying\n\nthat it's one's duty to live well — for example by saying, as some\n\nChristians have, that it's one's duty to make the most of one's\n\nGod-given gifts. But this seems one of those casuistries people\n\ninvented to evade the stern requirements of religion: it was permissible to\n\nspend time studying math instead of praying or performing acts of\n\ncharity because otherwise you were rejecting a gift God had given\n\nyou. A useful casuistry no doubt, but we don't need it.We could also combine the first two principles, since people are\n\npart of the world. Why should our species get special treatment?\n\nI won't try to justify this choice, but I'm skeptical that anyone\n\nwho claims to think differently actually lives according to their\n\nprinciples.[2]\n\nConfucius was also excluded from public life after ending up\n\non the losing end of a power struggle, and presumably he too would\n\nnot be so famous now if it hadn't been for this long stretch of\n\nenforced leisure.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica\n\nLivingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1568, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:21.595202Z"}
{"id": "woke", "title": "The Origins of Wokeness", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/woke.html", "date": null, "content": "January 2025The word \"prig\" isn't very common now, but if you look up\n\nthe definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:\n\nA self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if\n\nsuperior to others.\n\nThis sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and\n\nits age is an important clue: it shows that although\n\nwokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an\n\ninstance of a much older one.There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a\n\nshallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates\n\nhis purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every\n\nsociety has these people. All that changes is the rules they\n\nenforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In\n\nStalin's Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the\n\nwoke, it's social justice.So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask\n\nis not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs.\n\nThe question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about\n\nthese ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to\n\nask when and where wokeness began.The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a\n\nsecond, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which\n\nstarted in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and\n\nthen returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally\n\npeaking after the riots of 2020.What was political correctness, exactly? I'm often asked to define\n\nboth this term and wokeness by people who think they're meaningless\n\nlabels, so I will. They both have the same definition:\n\nAn aggressively performative focus on social justice.\n\nIn other words, it's people being prigs about social\n\njustice. And that's the real problem — the\n\nperformativeness, not the social justice.\n\n[0]Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on\n\nthe scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one.\n\nI don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The\n\nproblem with political correctness was not that it focused\n\non marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in\n\nwhich it did so. Instead of going out into the world and\n\nquietly helping members of marginalized groups, the\n\npolitically correct focused on getting people in trouble for\n\nusing the wrong words to talk about them.As for where political correctness began, if you think about\n\nit, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin\n\noutside universities and spread to them from this external\n\nsource? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in\n\nuniversities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it\n\nbegin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and\n\nspread from there to the humanities and social sciences?\n\nThose are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the\n\nhumanities and social sciences.Why there? And why then? What happened in the humanities and\n\nsocial sciences in the 1980s?A successful theory of the origin of political correctness\n\nhas to be able to explain why it didn't happen earlier. Why\n\ndidn't it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s,\n\nfor example? They were concerned with much the same issues.\n\n[1]The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to\n\npolitical correctness was precisely that — they were\n\nstudent movements. They didn't have any real power. The\n\nstudents may have been talking a lot about women's\n\nliberation and black power, but it was not what they were\n\nbeing taught in their classes. Not yet.But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s\n\nbegan to finish their dissertations and get hired as\n\nprofessors. At first they were neither powerful nor\n\nnumerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the\n\nprevious generation of professors started to retire, they\n\ngradually became both.The reason political correctness began in the humanities and\n\nsocial sciences was that these fields offered more scope for\n\nthe injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as\n\na physics professor could still attend protests, but his\n\npolitical beliefs wouldn't affect his work. Whereas research\n\nin sociology and modern literature can be made as political\n\nas you like.\n\n[2]I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in\n\n1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if\n\nsomeone said something they considered sexist, but no one\n\nwas getting reported for it. It was still not a thing when\n\nI started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in\n\n1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade\n\ncampus life.What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were\n\nthe late 1980s the point at which protests against male\n\nchauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal\n\ncomplaints to university authorities about sexism?\n\nBasically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the\n\nEstablishment they'd protested against two decades before.\n\nNow they were in a position not just to speak out about\n\ntheir ideas, but to enforce them.A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a\n\ncertain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting\n\nwas that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember\n\nnoticing that aspect of political correctness at the time.\n\nIt wasn't simply a grass-roots student movement. It was\n\nfaculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty\n\nmembers. In that respect it was like the Cultural\n\nRevolution. That wasn't a grass-roots movement either; that\n\nwas Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political\n\nopponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started\n\nteaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in\n\nthe late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events.\n\nI don't know if it actually was, but people thought it was,\n\nand that means the similarities were obvious.\n\n[3]College students larp. It's their nature. It's usually\n\nharmless. But larping morality turned out to be a poisonous\n\ncombination. The result was a kind of moral etiquette,\n\nsuperficial but very complicated. Imagine having to explain\n\nto a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the\n\nphrase \"people of color\" is considered particularly\n\nenlightened, but saying \"colored people\" gets you fired. And\n\nwhy exactly one isn't supposed to use the word \"negro\" now,\n\neven though Martin Luther King used it constantly in his\n\nspeeches. There are no underlying principles. You'd just\n\nhave to give him a long list of rules to memorize.\n\n[4]\n\nThe danger of these rules was not just that they created\n\nland mines for the unwary, but that their elaborateness made\n\nthem an effective substitute for virtue. Whenever a society\n\nhas a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a\n\nsubstitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the\n\nworld, but as long as you're orthodox you're better than\n\neveryone who isn't. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to\n\nbad people.But for it to work as a substitute for virtue, orthodoxy\n\nmust be difficult. If all you have to do to be orthodox is\n\nwear some garment or avoid saying some word, everyone knows\n\nto do it, and the only way to seem more virtuous than other\n\npeople is to actually be virtuous. The shallow, complicated,\n\nand frequently changing rules of political correctness made\n\nit the perfect substitute for actual virtue. And the result\n\nwas a world in which good people who weren't up to date on\n\ncurrent moral fashions were brought down by people whose\n\ncharacters would make you recoil in horror if you could see\n\nthem.One big contributing factor in the rise of political\n\ncorrectness was the lack of other things to be morally pure\n\nabout. Previous generations of prigs had been prigs mostly\n\nabout religion and sex. But among the cultural elite these\n\nwere the deadest of dead letters by the 1980s; if you were\n\nreligious, or a virgin, this was something you tended to\n\nconceal rather than advertise. So the sort of people who\n\nenjoy being moral enforcers had become starved of things to\n\nenforce. A new set of rules was just what they'd been\n\nwaiting for.Curiously enough, the tolerant side of the 1960s left helped\n\ncreate the conditions in which the intolerant side\n\nprevailed. The relaxed social rules advocated by the old,\n\neasy-going hippy left became the dominant ones, at least\n\namong the elite, and this left nothing for the naturally\n\nintolerant to be intolerant about.Another possibly contributing factor was the fall of the\n\nSoviet empire. Marxism had been a popular focus of moral\n\npurity on the left before political correctness emerged as a\n\ncompetitor, but the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Bloc\n\ncountries took most of the shine off it. Especially the fall\n\nof the Berlin Wall in 1989. You couldn't be on the side of\n\nthe Stasi. I remember looking at the moribund Soviet Studies\n\nsection of a used bookshop in Cambridge in the late 1980s\n\nand thinking \"what will those people go on about now?\" As it\n\nturned out the answer was right under my nose.One thing I noticed at the time about the first phase of\n\npolitical correctness was that it was more popular with\n\nwomen than men. As many writers (perhaps most eloquently\n\nGeorge Orwell) have observed, women seem more attracted than\n\nmen to the idea of being moral enforcers. But there was\n\nanother more specific reason women tended to be the\n\nenforcers of political correctness. There was at this time a\n\ngreat backlash against sexual harassment; the mid 1980s were\n\nthe point when the definition of sexual harassment was\n\nexpanded from explicit sexual advances to creating a\n\n\"hostile environment.\" Within universities the classic form\n\nof accusation was for a (female) student to say that a\n\nprofessor made her \"feel uncomfortable.\" But the vagueness\n\nof this accusation allowed the radius of forbidden behavior\n\nto expand to include talking about heterodox ideas. Those\n\nmake people uncomfortable too.\n\n[5]Was it sexist to propose that Darwin's greater male\n\nvariability hypothesis might explain some variation in human\n\nperformance? Sexist enough to get Larry Summers pushed out\n\nas president of Harvard, apparently. One woman who heard the\n\ntalk in which he mentioned this idea said it made her feel\n\n\"physically ill\" and that she had to leave halfway through.\n\nIf the test of a hostile environment is how it makes people\n\nfeel, this certainly sounds like one. And yet it does seem\n\nplausible that greater male variability explains some of the\n\nvariation in human performance. So which should prevail,\n\ncomfort or truth? Surely if truth should prevail anywhere,\n\nit should be in universities; that's supposed to be their\n\nspecialty; but for decades starting in the late 1980s the\n\npolitically correct tried to pretend this conflict didn't\n\nexist.\n\n[6]Political correctness seemed to burn out in the second half\n\nof the 1990s. One reason, perhaps the main reason, was that\n\nit literally became a joke. It offered rich material for\n\ncomedians, who performed their usual disinfectant action\n\nupon it. Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against\n\npriggishness of any sort, because prigs, being humorless,\n\ncan't respond in kind. Humor was what defeated Victorian\n\nprudishness, and by 2000 it seemed to have done the same\n\nthing to political correctness.Unfortunately this was an illusion. Within universities the\n\nembers of political correctness were still glowing brightly.\n\nAfter all, the forces that created it were still there. The\n\nprofessors who started it were now becoming deans and\n\ndepartment heads. And in addition to their departments there\n\nwere now a bunch of new ones explicitly focused on social\n\njustice. Students were still hungry for things to be morally\n\npure about. And there had been an explosion in the number of\n\nuniversity administrators, many of whose jobs involved\n\nenforcing various forms of political correctness.In the early 2010s the embers of political correctness burst\n\ninto flame anew. There were several differences between this\n\nnew phase and the original one. It was more virulent. It\n\nspread further into the real world, although it still burned\n\nhottest within universities. And it was concerned with a\n\nwider variety of sins. In the first phase of political\n\ncorrectness there were really only three things people got\n\naccused of: sexism, racism, and homophobia (which at the\n\ntime was a neologism invented for the purpose). But between\n\nthen and 2010 a lot of people had spent a lot of time trying\n\nto invent new kinds of -isms and -phobias and seeing which\n\ncould be made to stick.The second phase was, in multiple senses, political\n\ncorrectness metastasized. Why did it happen when it did? My\n\nguess is that it was due to the rise of social media,\n\nparticularly Tumblr and Twitter, because one of the most\n\ndistinctive features of the second wave of political\n\ncorrectness was the cancel mob: a mob of angry people\n\nuniting on social media to get someone ostracized or fired.\n\nIndeed this second wave of political correctness was\n\noriginally called \"cancel culture\"; it didn't start to be\n\ncalled \"wokeness\" till the 2020s.One aspect of social media that surprised almost everyone at\n\nfirst was the popularity of outrage. Users seemed to like\n\nbeing outraged. We're so used to this idea now that we take\n\nit for granted, but really it's pretty strange. Being\n\noutraged is not a pleasant feeling. You wouldn't expect\n\npeople to seek it out. But they do. And above all, they want\n\nto share it. I happened to be running a forum from 2007 to\n\n2014, so I can actually quantify how much they want to share\n\nit: our users were about three times more likely to upvote\n\nsomething if it outraged them.This tilt toward outrage wasn't due to wokeness. It's an\n\ninherent feature of social media, or at least this\n\ngeneration of it. But it did make social media the perfect\n\nmechanism for fanning the flames of wokeness.\n\n[7]It wasn't just public social networks that drove the rise of\n\nwokeness though. Group chat apps were also critical,\n\nespecially in the final step, cancellation. Imagine if a\n\ngroup of employees trying to get someone fired had to do it\n\nusing only email. It would be hard to organize a mob. But\n\nonce you have group chat, mobs form naturally.Another contributing factor in this second wave of political\n\ncorrectness was the dramatic increase in the polarization of\n\nthe press. In the print era, newspapers were constrained to\n\nbe, or at least seem, politically neutral. The department\n\nstores that ran ads in the New York Times wanted to reach\n\neveryone in the region, both liberal and conservative, so\n\nthe Times had to serve both. But the Times didn't regard\n\nthis neutrality as something forced upon them. They embraced\n\nit as their duty as a paper of record — as one of the big\n\nnewspapers that aimed to be chronicles of their times,\n\nreporting every sufficiently important story from a neutral\n\npoint of view.When I grew up the papers of record seemed timeless, almost\n\nsacred institutions. Papers like the New York Times and\n\nWashington Post had immense prestige, partly because other\n\nsources of news were limited, but also because they did make\n\nsome effort to be neutral.Unfortunately it turned out that the paper of record was\n\nmostly an artifact of the constraints imposed by print.\n\n[8]\n\nWhen your market was determined by geography, you had\n\nto be neutral. But publishing online enabled — in fact\n\nprobably forced — newspapers to switch to serving markets\n\ndefined by ideology instead of geography. Most that remained\n\nin business fell in the direction they'd already been\n\nleaning: left. On October 11, 2020 the New York Times\n\nannounced that \"The paper is in the midst of an evolution\n\nfrom the stodgy paper of record into a juicy collection of\n\ngreat narratives.\"\n\n[9]\n\nMeanwhile journalists, of a sort,\n\nhad arisen to serve the right as well. And so journalism,\n\nwhich in the previous era had been one of the great\n\ncentralizing forces, now became one of the great polarizing\n\nones.The rise of social media and the increasing polarization of\n\njournalism reinforced one another. In fact there arose a new\n\nvariety of journalism involving a loop through social media.\n\nSomeone would say something controversial on social media.\n\nWithin hours it would become a news story. Outraged readers\n\nwould then post links to the story on social media, driving\n\nfurther arguments online. It was the cheapest source of\n\nclicks imaginable. You didn't have to maintain overseas news\n\nbureaus or pay for month-long investigations. All you had to\n\ndo was watch Twitter for controversial remarks and repost\n\nthem on your site, with some additional comments to inflame\n\nreaders further.For the press there was money in wokeness. But they weren't\n\nthe only ones. That was one of the biggest differences\n\nbetween the two waves of political correctness: the first\n\nwas driven almost entirely by amateurs, but the second was\n\noften driven by professionals. For some it was their whole\n\njob. By 2010 a new class of administrators had arisen whose\n\njob was basically to enforce wokeness. They played a role\n\nsimilar to that of the political commissars who got attached\n\nto military and industrial organizations in the USSR: they\n\nweren't directly in the flow of the organization's work, but\n\nwatched from the side to ensure that nothing improper\n\nhappened in the doing of it. These new administrators could\n\noften be recognized by the word \"inclusion\" in their titles.\n\nWithin institutions this was the preferred euphemism for\n\nwokeness; a new list of banned words, for example, would\n\nusually be called an \"inclusive language guide.\"\n\n[10]This new class of bureaucrats pursued a woke agenda as if\n\ntheir jobs depended on it, because they did. If you hire\n\npeople to keep watch for a particular type of problem,\n\nthey're going to find it, because otherwise there's no\n\njustification for their existence.\n\n[11]\n\nBut these\n\nbureaucrats also represented a second and possibly even\n\ngreater danger. Many were involved in hiring, and when\n\npossible they tried to ensure their employers hired only\n\npeople who shared their political beliefs. The most\n\negregious cases were the new \"DEI statements\" that some\n\nuniversities started to require from faculty candidates,\n\nproving their commitment to wokeness. Some universities used\n\nthese statements as the initial filter and only even\n\nconsidered candidates who scored high enough on them. You're\n\nnot hiring Einstein that way; imagine what you get instead.Another factor in the rise of wokeness was the Black Lives\n\nMatter movement, which started in 2013 when a white man was\n\nacquitted after killing a black teenager in Florida. But\n\nthis didn't launch wokeness; it was well underway by 2013.Similarly for the Me Too Movement, which took off in 2017\n\nafter the first news stories about Harvey Weinstein's\n\nhistory of raping women. It accelerated wokeness, but didn't\n\nplay the same role in launching it that the 80s version did\n\nin launching political correctness.The election of Donald Trump in 2016 also accelerated\n\nwokeness, particularly in the press, where outrage now meant\n\ntraffic. Trump made the New York Times a lot of money:\n\nheadlines during his first administration mentioned his name\n\nat about four times the rate of previous presidents.In 2020 we saw the biggest accelerant of all, after a white\n\npolice officer asphyxiated a black suspect on video. At this\n\npoint the metaphorical fire became a literal one, as violent\n\nprotests broke out across America. But in retrospect this\n\nturned out to be peak woke, or close to it. By every measure\n\nI've seen, wokeness peaked in 2020 or 2021.Wokeness is sometimes described as a mind-virus. What makes\n\nit viral is that it defines new types of impropriety. Most\n\npeople are afraid of impropriety; they're never exactly sure\n\nwhat the social rules are or which ones they might be\n\nbreaking. Especially if the rules change rapidly. And since\n\nmost people already worry that they might be breaking rules\n\nthey don't know about, if you tell them they're breaking a\n\nrule, their default reaction is to believe you. Especially\n\nif multiple people tell them. Which in turn is a recipe for\n\nexponential growth. Zealots invent some new impropriety to\n\navoid. The first people to adopt it are fellow zealots,\n\neager for new ways to signal their virtue. If there are\n\nenough of these, the initial group of zealots is followed by\n\na much larger group, motivated by fear. They're not trying\n\nto signal virtue; they're just trying to avoid getting in\n\ntrouble. At this point the new impropriety is now firmly\n\nestablished. Plus its success has increased the rate of\n\nchange in social rules, which, remember, is one of the\n\nreasons people are nervous about which rules they might be\n\nbreaking. So the cycle accelerates.\n\n[12]What's true of individuals is even more true of\n\norganizations. Especially organizations without a powerful\n\nleader. Such organizations do everything based on \"best\n\npractices.\" There's no higher authority; if some new \"best\n\npractice\" achieves critical mass, they must adopt it. And\n\nin this case the organization can't do what it usually does\n\nwhen it's uncertain: delay. It might be committing\n\nimproprieties right now! So it's surprisingly easy for a\n\nsmall group of zealots to capture this type of organization\n\nby describing new improprieties it might be guilty of.\n\n[13]How does this kind of cycle ever end? Eventually it leads to\n\ndisaster, and people start to say enough is enough. The\n\nexcesses of 2020 made a lot of people say that.Since then wokeness has been in gradual but continual\n\nretreat. Corporate CEOs, starting with Brian Armstrong, have\n\nopenly rejected it. Universities, led by the University of\n\nChicago and MIT, have explicitly confirmed their commitment\n\nto free speech. Twitter, which was arguably the hub of\n\nwokeness, was bought by Elon Musk in order to neutralize it,\n\nand he seems to have succeeded — and not, incidentally, by\n\ncensoring left-wing users the way Twitter used to censor\n\nright-wing ones, but without censoring either.\n\n[14]\n\nConsumers have emphatically rejected brands that ventured\n\ntoo far into wokeness. The Bud Light brand may have been\n\npermanently damaged by it. I'm not going to claim Trump's\n\nsecond victory in 2024 was a referendum on wokeness; I think\n\nhe won, as presidential candidates always do, because he was\n\nmore charismatic; but voters'\n\ndisgust with wokeness must have helped.So what do we do now? Wokeness is already in retreat.\n\nObviously we should help it along. What's the best way to do\n\nthat? And more importantly, how do we avoid a third\n\noutbreak? After all, it seemed to be dead once, but came\n\nback worse than ever.In fact there's an even more ambitious goal: is there a way\n\nto prevent any similar outbreak of aggressively performative\n\nmoralism in the future — not just a third outbreak of\n\npolitical correctness, but the next thing like it? Because\n\nthere will be a next thing. Prigs are prigs by nature. They\n\nneed rules to obey and enforce, and now that Darwin has cut\n\noff their traditional supply of rules, they're constantly\n\nhungry for new ones. All they need is someone to meet them\n\nhalfway by defining a new way to be morally pure, and we'll\n\nsee the same phenomenon again.Let's start with the easier problem. Is there a simple,\n\nprincipled way to deal with wokeness? I think there is: to\n\nuse the customs we already have for dealing with religion.\n\nWokeness is effectively a religion, just with God replaced\n\nby protected classes. It's not even the first religion of\n\nthis kind; Marxism had a similar form, with God replaced by\n\nthe masses.\n\n[15]\n\nAnd we already have well-established\n\ncustoms for dealing with religion within organizations. You\n\ncan express your own religious identity and explain your\n\nbeliefs, but you can't call your coworkers infidels if they\n\ndisagree, or try to ban them from saying things that\n\ncontradict its doctrines, or insist that the organization\n\nadopt yours as its official religion.If we're not sure what to do about any particular\n\nmanifestation of wokeness, imagine we were dealing with some\n\nother religion, like Christianity. Should we have people\n\nwithin organizations whose jobs are to enforce woke\n\northodoxy? No, because we wouldn't have people whose jobs\n\nwere to enforce Christian orthodoxy. Should we censor\n\nwriters or\n\nscientists whose work contradicts woke doctrines?\n\nNo, because we wouldn't do this to people whose work\n\ncontradicted Christian teachings. Should job candidates be\n\nrequired to write DEI statements? Of course not; imagine an\n\nemployer requiring proof of one's religious beliefs. Should\n\nstudents and employees have to participate in woke\n\nindoctrination sessions in which they're required to answer\n\nquestions about their beliefs to ensure compliance? No,\n\nbecause we wouldn't dream of catechizing people in this way\n\nabout their religion.\n\n[16]One shouldn't feel bad about not wanting to watch woke\n\nmovies any more than one would feel bad about not wanting to\n\nlisten to Christian rock. In my twenties I drove across\n\nAmerica several times, listening to local radio stations.\n\nOccasionally I'd turn the dial and hear some new song. But\n\nthe moment anyone mentioned Jesus I'd turn the dial again.\n\nEven the tiniest bit of being preached to was enough to make\n\nme lose interest.But by the same token we should not automatically reject\n\neverything the woke believe. I'm not a Christian, but I can\n\nsee that many Christian principles are good ones. It would\n\nbe a mistake to discard them all just because one didn't\n\nshare the religion that espoused them. It would be the sort\n\nof thing a religious zealot would do.If we have genuine pluralism, I think we'll be safe from\n\nfuture outbreaks of woke intolerance. Wokeness itself won't\n\ngo away. There will for the foreseeable future continue to\n\nbe pockets of woke zealots inventing new moral fashions. The\n\nkey is not to let them treat their fashions as normative.\n\nThey can change what their coreligionists are allowed to say\n\nevery few months if they like, but they mustn't be allowed\n\nto change what we're allowed to say.\n\n[17]The more general problem — how to prevent similar outbreaks\n\nof aggressively performative moralism — is of course\n\nharder. Here we're up against human nature. There will\n\nalways be prigs. And in particular there will always be the\n\nenforcers among them, the\n\naggressively conventional-minded.\n\nThese people are born that way. Every society has them. So\n\nthe best we can do is to keep them bottled up.The aggressively conventional-minded aren't always on the\n\nrampage. Usually they just enforce whatever random rules are\n\nnearest to hand. They only become dangerous when some new\n\nideology gets a lot of them pointed in the same direction at\n\nonce. That's what happened during the Cultural Revolution,\n\nand to a lesser extent (thank God) in the two waves of\n\npolitical correctness we've experienced.We can't get rid of the aggressively conventional-minded.\n\n[18]\n\nAnd we couldn't prevent people from creating new\n\nideologies that appealed to them even if we wanted to. So if\n\nwe want to keep them bottled up, we have to do it one step\n\ndownstream. Fortunately when the aggressively\n\nconventional-minded go on the rampage they always do one\n\nthing that gives them away: they define new heresies to\n\npunish people for. So the best way to protect ourselves from\n\nfuture outbreaks of things like wokeness is to have powerful\n\nantibodies against the concept of heresy.We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms\n\nof heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something\n\nthat we'd previously been able to say, our initial\n\nassumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial\n\nassumption of course. If they can prove we should stop\n\nsaying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on\n\nthem. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent\n\nsomething from being said will usually claim they're not\n\nmerely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some\n\nform of \"harm\". And maybe they're right. But once again, the\n\nburden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm;\n\nthey have to prove it.As long as the aggressively conventional-minded continue to\n\ngive themselves away by banning heresies, we'll always be\n\nable to notice when they become aligned behind some new\n\nideology. And if we always fight back at that point, with\n\nany luck we can stop them in their tracks.The number of true things we can't say\n\nshould not increase. If it does, something is wrong.Notes[0]\n\nThis was not the original meaning of \"woke,\" but it's rarely\n\nused in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is\n\nthe dominant one.[1]\n\nWhy did 1960s radicals focus on the causes they did?\n\nOne of the people who reviewed drafts of this essay\n\nexplained this so well that I asked if I could quote him:\n\nThe middle-class student protestors of the New Left\n\nrejected the socialist/Marxist left as unhip. They were\n\ninterested in sexier forms of oppression uncovered by\n\ncultural analysis (Marcuse) and abstruse \"Theory\". Labor\n\npolitics became stodgy and old-fashioned. This took a\n\ncouple generations to work through. The woke ideology's\n\nconspicuous lack of interest in the working class is the\n\ntell-tale sign. Such fragments as are, er, left of the old\n\nleft are anti-woke, and meanwhile the actual working class\n\nshifted to the populist right and gave us Trump. Trump and\n\nwokeness are cousins.The middle-class origins of wokeness smoothed its way\n\nthrough the institutions because it had no interest in\n\n\"seizing the means of production\" (how quaint such phrases\n\nseem now), which would quickly have run up against hard\n\nstate and corporate power. The fact that wokeness only\n\nexpressed interest in other kinds of class (race, sex,\n\netc) signalled compromise with existing power: give us\n\npower within your system and we'll bestow the resource we\n\ncontrol — moral rectitude — upon you. As an ideological\n\nstalking horse for gaining control over discourse and\n\ninstitutions, this succeeded where a more ambitious\n\nrevolutionary program would not have.\n\n[2]\n\nIt helped that the humanities and social sciences also\n\nincluded some of the biggest and easiest undergrad majors.\n\nIf a political movement had to start with physics students,\n\nit could never get off the ground; there would be too few of\n\nthem, and they wouldn't have the time to spare.At the top universities these majors are not as big as they\n\nused to be, though. A\n\n2022 survey found that only 7% of\n\nHarvard undergrads plan to major in the humanities, vs\n\nnearly 30% during the 1970s. I expect wokeness is at least\n\npart of the reason; when undergrads consider majoring in\n\nEnglish, it's presumably because they love the written word\n\nand not because they want to listen to lectures about\n\nracism.[3]\n\nThe puppet-master-and-puppet character of political\n\ncorrectness became clearly visible when a bakery near\n\nOberlin College was falsely accused of race discrimination\n\nin 2016. In the subsequent civil trial, lawyers for the\n\nbakery produced a text message from Oberlin Dean of Students\n\nMeredith Raimondo that read \"I'd say unleash the students if\n\nI wasn't convinced this needs to be put behind us.\"[4]\n\nThe woke sometimes claim that wokeness is simply\n\ntreating people with respect. But if it were, that would be\n\nthe only rule you'd have to remember, and this is comically\n\nfar from being the case. My younger son likes to imitate\n\nvoices, and at one point when he was about seven I had to\n\nexplain which accents it was currently safe to imitate\n\npublicly and which not. It took about ten minutes, and I\n\nstill hadn't covered all the cases.[5]\n\nIn 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that creating a\n\nhostile work environment could constitute sex\n\ndiscrimination, which in turn affected universities via\n\nTitle IX. The court specified that the test of a hostile\n\nenvironment was whether it would bother a reasonable person,\n\nbut since for a professor merely being the subject of a\n\nsexual harassment complaint would be a disaster whether the\n\ncomplainant was reasonable or not, in practice any joke or\n\nremark remotely connected with sex was now effectively\n\nforbidden. Which meant we'd now come full circle to\n\nVictorian codes of behavior, when there was a large class of\n\nthings that might not be said \"with ladies present.\"[6]\n\nMuch as they tried to pretend there was no conflict\n\nbetween diversity and quality. But you can't simultaneously\n\noptimize for two things that aren't identical. What\n\ndiversity actually means, judging from the way the term is\n\nused, is proportional representation, and unless you're\n\nselecting a group whose purpose is to be representative,\n\nlike poll respondents, optimizing for proportional\n\nrepresentation has to come at the expense of quality. This\n\nis not because of anything about representation; it's the\n\nnature of optimization; optimizing for x has to come at the\n\nexpense of y unless x and y are identical.[7]\n\nMaybe societies will eventually develop antibodies to\n\nviral outrage. Maybe we were just the first to be exposed to\n\nit, so it tore through us like an epidemic through a\n\npreviously isolated population. I'm fairly confident that it\n\nwould be possible to create new social media apps that were\n\nless driven by outrage, and an app of this type would have a\n\ngood chance of stealing users from existing ones, because\n\nthe smartest people would tend to migrate to it.[8]\n\nI say \"mostly\" because I have hopes that journalistic\n\nneutrality will return in some form. There is some market\n\nfor unbiased news, and while it may be small, it's valuable.\n\nThe rich and powerful want to know what's really going on;\n\nthat's how they became rich and powerful.[9]\n\nThe Times made this momentous announcement very\n\ninformally, in passing in the middle of an\n\narticle about a\n\nTimes reporter who'd been criticized for inaccuracy. It's\n\nquite possible no senior editor even approved it. But it's\n\nsomehow appropriate that this particular universe ended with\n\na whimper rather than a bang.[10]\n\nAs the acronym DEI goes out of fashion, many of these\n\nbureaucrats will try to go underground by changing their\n\ntitles. It looks like \"belonging\" will be a popular option.[11]\n\nIf you've ever wondered why our legal system includes\n\nprotections like the separation of prosecutor, judge, and\n\njury, the right to examine evidence and cross-examine\n\nwitnesses, and the right to be represented by legal counsel,\n\nthe de facto\n\nparallel legal system\n\nestablished by Title IX\n\nmakes that all too clear.[12]\n\nThe invention of new improprieties is most visible in\n\nthe rapid evolution of woke nomenclature. This is\n\nparticularly annoying to me as a writer, because the new\n\nnames are always worse. Any religious observance has to be\n\ninconvenient and slightly absurd; otherwise gentiles would\n\ndo it too. So \"slaves\" becomes \"enslaved individuals.\" But\n\nweb search can show us the leading edge of moral growth in\n\nreal time: if you search for \"individuals experiencing\n\nslavery\" you will as of this writing find five legit\n\nattempts to use the phrase, and you'll even find two for\n\n\"individuals experiencing enslavement.\"[13]\n\nOrganizations that do dubious things are particularly\n\nconcerned with propriety, which is how you end up with\n\nabsurdities like tobacco and oil companies having higher ESG\n\nratings than Tesla.[14]\n\nElon did something else that tilted Twitter rightward\n\nthough: he gave more visibility to paying users. Paying\n\nusers lean right on average, because people on the far left\n\ndislike Elon and don't want to give him money. Elon\n\npresumably knew this would happen. On the other hand, the\n\npeople on the far left have only themselves to blame; they\n\ncould tilt Twitter back to the left tomorrow if they wanted\n\nto.[15]\n\nIt even, as James Lindsay and Peter Boghossian\n\npointed out, has a concept of original sin: privilege. Which\n\nmeans unlike Christianity's egalitarian version, people have varying\n\ndegrees of it. An able-bodied straight white\n\nAmerican male is born with such a load of sin that only by\n\nthe most abject repentance can he be saved.Wokeness also shares something rather funny with many actual\n\nversions of Christianity: like God, the people for whose\n\nsake wokeness purports to act are often revolted by the\n\nthings done in their name.[16]\n\nThere is one exception to most of these rules: actual\n\nreligious organizations. It's reasonable for them to insist\n\non orthodoxy. But they in turn should declare that they're\n\nreligious organizations. It's rightly considered shady\n\nwhen something that appears to be an ordinary business or\n\npublication turns out to be a religious organization.[17]\n\nI don't want to give the impression that it will be\n\nsimple to roll back wokeness. There will be places where the\n\nfight inevitably gets messy — particularly within\n\nuniversities, which everyone has to share, yet which are\n\ncurrently the most pervaded by wokeness of any institutions.[18]\n\nYou can however get rid of aggressively\n\nconventional-minded people within an organization, and in\n\nmany if not most organizations this would be an excellent\n\nidea. Even a handful of them can do a lot of damage. I bet\n\nyou'd feel a noticeable improvement going from a handful to\n\nnone.Thanks to Sam Altman,\n\nBen Miller, Daniel Gackle, Robin Hanson, Jessica\n\nLivingston, Greg Lukianoff, Harj Taggar, Garry Tan, and Tim\n\nUrban for reading drafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 6083, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:22.324656Z"}

Doctors know how many people have\n\na mole they're worried about; people who are good at setting up\n\ncomputers know how many people aren't; writers know how many people\n\nneed help writing.The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it's\n\nfundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly,\n\nand thinking clearly is hard.And yet writing pervades many jobs, and the more prestigious the\n\njob, the more writing it tends to require.These two powerful opposing forces, the pervasive expectation of\n\nwriting and the irreducible difficulty of doing it, create enormous\n\npressure. This is why eminent professors often turn out to have\n\nresorted to plagiarism. The most striking thing to me about these\n\ncases is the pettiness of the thefts. The stuff they steal is usually\n\nthe most mundane boilerplate — the sort of thing that anyone who\n\nwas even halfway decent at writing could turn out with no effort\n\nat all. Which means they're not even halfway decent at writing.Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure\n\ncreated by these opposing forces. You could pay someone to write\n\nfor you, like JFK, or plagiarize, like MLK, but if you couldn't buy\n\nor steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result\n\nnearly everyone who was expected to write had to learn how.Not anymore. AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to\n\nwrite has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school\n\nand at work.The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots.\n\nThere will still be some people who can write. Some of us like it.\n\nBut the middle ground between those who are good at writing and\n\nthose who can't write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers,\n\nok writers, and people who can't write, there will just be good\n\nwriters and people who can't write.Is that so bad? Isn't it common for skills to disappear when\n\ntechnology makes them obsolete? There aren't many blacksmiths left,\n\nand it doesn't seem to be a problem.Yes, it's bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing\n\nis thinking. In fact there's a kind of thinking that can only be\n\ndone by writing. You can't make this point better than Leslie Lamport\n\ndid:\n\nIf you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.\n\nSo a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous\n\nthan it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots. I know\n\nwhich half I want to be in, and I bet you do too.This situation is not unprecedented. In preindustrial times most\n\npeople's jobs made them strong. Now if you want to be strong, you\n\nwork out. So there are still strong people, but only those who\n\nchoose to be.It will be the same with writing. There will still be smart people,\n\nbut only those who choose to be.Thanks to Jessica Livingston, Ben Miller,\n\nand Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 541, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:22.925339Z"}
{"id": "when", "title": "When To Do What You Love", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/when.html", "date": null, "content": "September 2024There's some debate about whether it's a good idea to \"follow your\n\npassion.\" In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple\n\nyes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't, but\n\nthe border between should and shouldn't is very complicated. The\n\nonly way to give a general answer is to trace it.When people talk about this question, there's always an implicit\n\n\"instead of.\" All other things being equal, why wouldn't you work\n\non what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies\n\nthat all other things aren't equal, and that you have to choose\n\nbetween working on what interests you the most and something else,\n\nlike what pays the best.And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can't usually\n\nafford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for\n\ndoing what they want, not what you want. But there's an obvious\n\nexception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you\n\nlove football, and you're good enough at it, you can get paid a lot\n\nto play it.Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because\n\nso many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you\n\nshouldn't try though. It depends how much ability you have and how\n\nhard you're willing to work.The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like\n\nsomething that pays well and that few other people like. For example,\n\nit's clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company.\n\nHe didn't just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved\n\nwriting software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed,\n\nbut if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it.There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest\n\nin making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can't\n\nhelp noticing when something is mispriced, and can't help doing\n\nsomething about it. It's like a puzzle for them.\n\n[1]In fact there's an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all\n\nthe preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really\n\nhuge\n\namount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars\n\n— it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the\n\nmost. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing\n\nthis, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is\n\nto start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent\n\nway to discover startup ideas.Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the\n\nfounders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began\n\nthat way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas\n\ntend to be such outliers that you'd overlook them if you were\n\nconsciously looking for ways to make money. Whereas if you're young\n\nand good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would\n\nbe interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to\n\nbe built.So there's something like a midwit peak for making money. If you\n\ndon't need to make much, you can work on whatever you're most\n\ninterested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can't\n\nusually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you're\n\nyoung and good at technology, working on what you're most interested\n\nin becomes a good idea again.What if you're not sure what you want? What if you're attracted to\n\nthe idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work\n\nthan others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break\n\nties?The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent.\n\nWhen you have trouble choosing between following your interests and\n\nmaking money, it's never because you have complete knowledge of\n\nyourself and of the types of work you're choosing between, and the\n\noptions are perfectly balanced. When you can't decide which path\n\nto take, it's almost always due to ignorance. In fact you're usually\n\nsuffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don't\n\nknow what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really\n\nlike, or how well you could do them.\n\n[2]In a way this ignorance is excusable. It's often hard to predict\n\nthese things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you're\n\nambitious you're told you should go to college, and this is good\n\nadvice so far as it goes, but that's where it usually ends. No one\n\ntells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can\n\nbe.What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And\n\nprobably the best way to do that is to try working on things you're\n\ninterested in. That will get you more information about how interested\n\nyou are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they\n\noffer for ambition.Don't wait. Don't wait till the end of college to figure out what\n\nto work on. Don't even wait for internships during college. You\n\ndon't necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often\n\nyou can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring\n\nout what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve,\n\nthe sooner you start, the better.One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at\n\nwho your colleagues will be. You'll become like whoever you work\n\nwith. Do you want to become like these people?Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work\n\nis magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same\n\ndecisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well\n\nit pays, you'll be surrounded by other people who chose it for the\n\nsame reason, and that will make it even more soul-sucking than it\n\nseems from the outside. Whereas if you choose work you're genuinely\n\ninterested in, you'll be surrounded mostly by other people who are\n\ngenuinely interested in it, and that will make it extra inspiring.\n\n[3]The other thing you do in the face of uncertainty is to make choices\n\nthat are uncertainty-proof. The less sure you are about what to do,\n\nthe more important it is to choose options that give you more options\n\nin the future. I call this \"staying upwind.\" If you're unsure whether\n\nto major in math or economics, for example, choose math; math is\n\nupwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch\n\nlater from math to economics than from economics to math.There's one case, though, where it's easy to say whether you should\n\nwork on what interests you the most: if you want to do\n\ngreat work.\n\nThis is not a sufficient condition for doing great work, but it is\n\na necessary one.There's a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to \"follow\n\nyour passion,\" and this is the reason. Most such advice comes from\n\npeople who are famously successful, and if you ask someone who's\n\nfamously successful how to do what they did, most will tell you\n\nthat you have to work on what you're most interested in. And this\n\nis in fact true.That doesn't mean it's the right advice for everyone. Not everyone\n\ncan do great work, or wants to. But if you do want to, the complicated\n\nquestion of whether or not to work on what interests you the most\n\nbecomes simple. The answer is yes. The root of great work is a sort\n\nof ambitious curiosity, and you can't manufacture that.Notes[1]\n\nThese examples show why it's a mistake to assume that economic\n\ninequality must be evidence of some kind of brokenness or unfairness.\n\nIt's obvious that different people have different interests, and\n\nthat some interests yield far more money than others, so how can\n\nit not be obvious that some people will end up much richer than\n\nothers? In a world where some people like to write enterprise\n\nsoftware and others like to make studio pottery, economic inequality\n\nis the natural outcome.[2]\n\nDifficulty choosing between interests is a different matter.\n\nThat's not always due to ignorance. It's often intrinsically\n\ndifficult. I still have trouble doing it.[3]\n\nYou can't always take people at their word on this. Since\n\nit's more prestigious to work on things you're interested in than\n\nto be driven by money, people who are driven mainly by money will\n\noften claim to be more interested in their work than they actually\n\nare. One way to test such claims is by doing the following thought\n\nexperiment: if their work didn't pay well, would they take day jobs\n\ndoing something else in order to do it in their spare time? Lots\n\nof mathematicians and scientists and engineers would. Historically\n\nlots have. But I don't think as many investment bankers would.This thought experiment is also useful for distinguishing between\n\nuniversity departments.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit,\n\nJessica Livingston,\n\nRobert Morris, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of\n\nthis.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1519, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:23.527420Z"}
{"id": "foundermode", "title": "Founder Mode", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html", "date": null, "content": "September 2024At a YC event last week Brian Chesky gave a talk that everyone who\n\nwas there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said\n\nit was the best they'd ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time\n\nin his life, forgot to take notes. I'm not going to try to reproduce\n\nit here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.The theme of Brian's talk was that the conventional wisdom about\n\nhow to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning\n\npeople advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way\n\nfor it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized\n\nas \"hire good people and give them room to do their jobs.\" He\n\nfollowed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to\n\nfigure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying\n\nhow Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb's\n\nfree cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley.The audience at this event included a lot of the most successful\n\nfounders we've funded, and one after another said that the same\n\nthing had happened to them. They'd been given the same advice about\n\nhow to run their companies as they grew, but instead of helping\n\ntheir companies, it had damaged them.Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was\n\nthe big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured\n\nout the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company\n\nyou hadn't founded — how to run a company if you're merely a\n\nprofessional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that\n\nto founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that\n\nmanagers can't, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because\n\nit is.In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder\n\nmode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley\n\nhave implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to\n\nmanager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from\n\nthe dismay of founders who've tried it, and the success of their\n\nattempts to escape from it.There are as far as I know no books specifically about founder mode.\n\nBusiness schools don't know it exists. All we have so far are the\n\nexperiments of individual founders who've been figuring it out for\n\nthemselves. But now that we know what we're looking for, we can\n\nsearch for it. I hope in a few years founder mode will be as well\n\nunderstood as manager mode. We can already guess at some of the\n\nways it will differ.The way managers are taught to run companies seems to be like modular\n\ndesign in the sense that you treat subtrees of the org chart as\n\nblack boxes. You tell your direct reports what to do, and it's up\n\nto them to figure out how. But you don't get involved in the details\n\nof what they do. That would be micromanaging them, which is bad.Hire good people and give them room to do their jobs. Sounds great\n\nwhen it's described that way, doesn't it? Except in practice, judging\n\nfrom the report of founder after founder, what this often turns out\n\nto mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company\n\ninto the ground.One theme I noticed both in Brian's talk and when talking to founders\n\nafterward was the idea of being gaslit. Founders feel like they're\n\nbeing gaslit from both sides — by the people telling them they\n\nhave to run their companies like managers, and by the people working\n\nfor them when they do. Usually when everyone around you disagrees\n\nwith you, your default assumption should be that you're mistaken.\n\nBut this is one of the rare exceptions. VCs who haven't been founders\n\nthemselves don't know how founders should run companies, and C-level\n\nexecs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the\n\nworld.\n\n[1]Whatever founder mode consists of, it's pretty clear that it's going\n\nto break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company\n\nonly via his or her direct reports. \"Skip-level\" meetings will\n\nbecome the norm instead of a practice so unusual that there's a\n\nname for it. And once you abandon that constraint there are a huge\n\nnumber of permutations to choose from.For example, Steve Jobs used to run an annual retreat for what he\n\nconsidered the 100 most important people at Apple, and these were\n\nnot the 100 people highest on the org chart. Can you imagine the\n\nforce of will it would take to do this at the average company? And\n\nyet imagine how useful such a thing could be. It could make a big\n\ncompany feel like a startup. Steve presumably wouldn't have kept\n\nhaving these retreats if they didn't work. But I've never heard of\n\nanother company doing this. So is it a good idea, or a bad one? We\n\nstill don't know. That's how little we know about founder mode.\n\n[2]Obviously founders can't keep running a 2000 person company the way\n\nthey ran it when it had 20. There's going to have to be some amount\n\nof delegation. Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp\n\nthey are, will probably vary from company to company. They'll even\n\nvary from time to time within the same company, as managers earn\n\ntrust. So founder mode will be more complicated than manager mode.\n\nBut it will also work better. We already know that from the examples\n\nof individual founders groping their way toward it.Indeed, another prediction I'll make about founder mode is that\n\nonce we figure out what it is, we'll find that a number of individual\n\nfounders were already most of the way there — except that in doing\n\nwhat they did they were regarded by many as eccentric or worse.\n\n[3]Curiously enough it's an encouraging thought that we still know so\n\nlittle about founder mode. Look at what founders have achieved\n\nalready, and yet they've achieved this against a headwind of bad\n\nadvice. Imagine what they'll do once we can tell them how to run\n\ntheir companies like Steve Jobs instead of John Sculley.Notes[1]\n\nThe more diplomatic way of phrasing this statement would be\n\nto say that experienced C-level execs are often very skilled at\n\nmanaging up. And I don't think anyone with knowledge of this world\n\nwould dispute that.[2]\n\nIf the practice of having such retreats became so widespread\n\nthat even mature companies dominated by politics started to do it,\n\nwe could quantify the senescence of companies by the average depth\n\non the org chart of those invited.[3]\n\nI also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as\n\nthe concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start\n\nmisusing it. Founders who are unable to delegate even things they\n\nshould will use founder mode as the excuse. Or managers who aren't\n\nfounders will decide they should try to act like founders. That may\n\neven work, to some extent, but the results will be messy when it\n\ndoesn't; the modular approach does at least limit the damage a bad\n\nCEO can do.Thanks to Brian Chesky, Patrick Collison,\n\nRon Conway, Jessica\n\nLivingston, Elon Musk, Ryan Petersen, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan\n\nfor reading drafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1225, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:24.127259Z"}
{"id": "persistence", "title": "The Right Kind of Stubborn", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/persistence.html", "date": null, "content": "July 2024Successful people tend to be persistent. New ideas often don't work\n\nat first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually\n\nfind something that does.Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate\n\npeople are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads\n\nagainst a wall and get nowhere.But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are\n\npersistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or\n\nare they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as\n\npersistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be\n\nright or not?If that's the only difference then there's nothing to be learned\n\nfrom the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than\n\nobstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong,\n\nand they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy\n\nare actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile\n\nto tease them apart.\n\n[1]I've talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that\n\nthey're different kinds of behavior. I've often walked away from a\n\nconversation thinking either \"Wow, that guy is determined\" or \"Damn,\n\nthat guy is stubborn,\" and I don't think I'm just talking about\n\nwhether they seemed right or not. That's part of it, but not all\n\nof it.There's something annoying about the obstinate that's not simply\n\ndue to being mistaken. They won't listen. And that's not true of\n\nall determined people. I can't think of anyone more determined than\n\nthe Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them,\n\nthey not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity.\n\nIs there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if\n\nthere is, they want to know about it.It's the same with most successful people. They're never more\n\nengaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate\n\ndon't want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes\n\nglaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about\n\nmatters of doctrine.\n\n[2]The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is that\n\nthey're both hard to stop. But they're hard to stop in different\n\nsenses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can't be throttled\n\nback. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can't be turned.\n\n[3]In the degenerate case they're indistinguishable: when there's only\n\none way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to give up\n\nor not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is presumably\n\nwhy the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It assumes\n\nsimple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can see\n\nthe difference between them. The persistent are much more attached\n\nto points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down,\n\nwhile the obstinate spray \"don't give up\" indiscriminately over the\n\nwhole tree.The persistent are attached to the goal. The obstinate are attached\n\nto their ideas about how to reach it.Worse still, that means they'll tend to be attached to their first\n\nideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are the least\n\ninformed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate aren't\n\nmerely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be\n\nattached to wrong ones.Why are they like this? Why are the obstinate obstinate? One\n\npossibility is that they're overwhelmed. They're not very capable.\n\nThey take on a hard problem. They're immediately in over their head.\n\nSo they grab onto ideas the way someone on the deck of a rolling\n\nship might grab onto the nearest handhold.That was my initial theory, but on examination it doesn't hold up.\n\nIf being obstinate were simply a consequence of being in over one's\n\nhead, you could make persistent people become obstinate by making\n\nthem solve harder problems. But that's not what happens. If you\n\nhanded the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they\n\nwouldn't become obstinate. If anything they'd become less obstinate.\n\nThey'd know they had to be open to anything.Similarly, if obstinacy were caused by the situation, the obstinate\n\nwould stop being obstinate when solving easier problems. But they\n\ndon't. And if obstinacy isn't caused by the situation, it must come\n\nfrom within. It must be a feature of one's personality.Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas. This\n\nis not identical with stupidity, but they're closely related. A\n\nreflexive resistance to changing one's ideas becomes a sort of\n\ninduced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy is a\n\nform of not giving up that's easily practiced by the stupid. You\n\ndon't have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your\n\nheels. It even works, up to a point.The fact that obstinacy works for simple problems is an important\n\nclue. Persistence and obstinacy aren't opposites. The relationship\n\nbetween them is more like the relationship between the two kinds\n\nof respiration we can do: aerobic respiration, and the anaerobic\n\nrespiration we inherited from our most distant ancestors. Anaerobic\n\nrespiration is a more primitive process, but it has its uses. When\n\nyou leap suddenly away from a threat, that's what you're using.The optimal amount of obstinacy is not zero. It can be good if your\n\ninitial reaction to a setback is an unthinking \"I won't give up,\"\n\nbecause this helps prevent panic. But unthinking only gets you so\n\nfar. The further someone is toward the obstinate end of the continuum,\n\nthe less likely they are to succeed in solving hard problems.\n\n[4]Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it. But persistence turns\n\nout to have a fairly complicated internal structure.One thing that distinguishes the persistent is their energy. At the\n\nrisk of putting too much weight on words, they persist rather than\n\nmerely resisting. They keep trying things. Which means the persistent\n\nmust also be imaginative. To keep trying things, you have to keep\n\nthinking of things to try.Energy and imagination make a wonderful combination. Each gets the\n\nbest out of the other. Energy creates demand for the ideas produced\n\nby imagination, which thus produces more, and imagination gives\n\nenergy somewhere to go.\n\n[5]Merely having energy and imagination is quite rare. But to solve\n\nhard problems you need three more qualities: resilience, good\n\njudgement, and a focus on some kind of goal.Resilience means not having one's morale destroyed by setbacks.\n\nSetbacks are inevitable once problems reach a certain size, so if\n\nyou can't bounce back from them, you can only do good work on a\n\nsmall scale. But resilience is not the same as obstinacy. Resilience\n\nmeans setbacks can't change your morale, not that they can't change\n\nyour mind.Indeed, persistence often requires that one change one's mind.\n\nThat's where good judgement comes in. The persistent are quite\n\nrational. They focus on expected value. It's this, not recklessness,\n\nthat lets them work on things that are unlikely to succeed.There is one point at which the persistent are often irrational\n\nthough: at the very top of the decision tree. When they choose\n\nbetween two problems of roughly equal expected value, the choice\n\nusually comes down to personal preference. Indeed, they'll often\n\nclassify projects into deliberately wide bands of expected value\n\nin order to ensure that the one they want to work on still qualifies.Empirically this doesn't seem to be a problem. It's ok to be\n\nirrational near the top of the decision tree. One reason is that\n\nwe humans will work harder on a problem we love. But there's another\n\nmore subtle factor involved as well: our preferences among problems\n\naren't random. When we love a problem that other people don't, it's\n\noften because we've unconsciously noticed that it's more important\n\nthan they realize.Which leads to our fifth quality: there needs to be some overall\n\ngoal. If you're like me you began, as a kid, merely with the desire\n\nto do something great. In theory that should be the most powerful\n\nmotivator of all, since it includes everything that could possibly\n\nbe done. But in practice it's not much use, precisely because it\n\nincludes too much. It doesn't tell you what to do at this moment.So in practice your energy and imagination and resilience and good\n\njudgement have to be directed toward some fairly specific goal. Not\n\ntoo specific, or you might miss a great discovery adjacent to what\n\nyou're searching for, but not too general, or it won't work to\n\nmotivate you.\n\n[6]When you look at the internal structure of persistence, it doesn't\n\nresemble obstinacy at all. It's so much more complex. Five distinct\n\nqualities — energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement, and\n\nfocus on a goal — combine to produce a phenomenon that seems a bit\n\nlike obstinacy in the sense that it causes you not to give up. But\n\nthe way you don't give up is completely different. Instead of merely\n\nresisting change, you're driven toward a goal by energy and resilience,\n\nthrough paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement.\n\nYou'll give way on any point low down in the decision tree, if its\n\nexpected value drops sufficiently, but energy and resilience keep\n\npushing you toward whatever you chose higher up.Considering what it's made of, it's not surprising that the right\n\nkind of stubbornness is so much rarer than the wrong kind, or that\n\nit gets so much better results. Anyone can do obstinacy. Indeed,\n\nkids and drunks and fools are best at it. Whereas very few people\n\nhave enough of all five of the qualities that produce the right kind\n\nof stubbornness, but when they do the results are magical.\n\nNotes[1]\n\nI'm going to use \"persistent\" for the good kind of stubborn\n\nand \"obstinate\" for the bad kind, but I can't claim I'm simply\n\nfollowing current usage. Conventional opinion barely distinguishes\n\nbetween good and bad kinds of stubbornness, and usage is correspondingly\n\npromiscuous. I could have invented a new word for the good kind,\n\nbut it seemed better just to stretch \"persistent.\"[2]\n\nThere are some domains where one can succeed by being obstinate.\n\nSome political leaders have been notorious for it. But it won't\n\nwork in situations where you have to pass external tests. And indeed\n\nthe political leaders who are famous for being obstinate are famous\n\nfor getting power, not for using it well.[3]\n\nThere will be some resistance to turning the rudder of a\n\npersistent person, because there's some cost to changing direction.[4]\n\nThe obstinate do sometimes succeed in solving hard problems.\n\nOne way is through luck: like the stopped clock that's right twice\n\na day, they seize onto some arbitrary idea, and it turns out to be\n\nright. Another is when their obstinacy cancels out some other form\n\nof error. For example, if a leader has overcautious subordinates,\n\ntheir estimates of the probability of success will always be off\n\nin the same direction. So if he mindlessly says \"push ahead regardless\"\n\nin every borderline case, he'll usually turn out to be right.[5]\n\nIf you stop there, at just energy and imagination, you get\n\nthe conventional caricature of an artist or poet.[6]\n\nStart by erring on the small side. If you're inexperienced\n\nyou'll inevitably err on one side or the other, and if you err on\n\nthe side of making the goal too broad, you won't get anywhere.\n\nWhereas if you err on the small side you'll at least be moving\n\nforward.

{"id": "reddits", "title": "The Reddits", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/reddits.html", "date": null, "content": "March 2024I met the Reddits before we even started Y Combinator. In fact they\n\nwere one of the reasons we started it.YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society (the\n\nundergrad computer club) about how to start a startup. Everyone\n\nelse in the audience was probably local, but Steve and Alexis came\n\nup on the train from the University of Virginia, where they were\n\nseniors. Since they'd come so far I agreed to meet them for coffee.\n\nThey told me about the startup idea we'd later fund them to drop:\n\na way to order fast food on your cellphone.This was before smartphones. They'd have had to make deals with\n\ncell carriers and fast food chains just to get it launched. So it\n\nwas not going to happen. It still doesn't exist, 19 years later.\n\nBut I was impressed with their brains and their energy. In fact I\n\nwas so impressed with them and some of the other people I met at\n\nthat talk that I decided to start something to fund them. A few\n\ndays later I told Steve and Alexis that we were starting Y Combinator,\n\nand encouraged them to apply.That first batch we didn't have any way to identify applicants, so\n\nwe made up nicknames for them. The Reddits were the \"Cell food\n\nmuffins.\" \"Muffin\" is a term of endearment Jessica uses for things\n\nlike small dogs and two year olds. So that gives you some idea what\n\nkind of impression Steve and Alexis made in those days. They had\n\nthe look of slightly ruffled surprise that baby birds have.Their idea was bad though. And since we thought then that we were\n\nfunding ideas rather than founders, we rejected them. But we felt\n\nbad about it. Jessica was sad that we'd rejected the muffins. And\n\nit seemed wrong to me to turn down the people we'd been inspired\n\nto start YC to fund.I don't think the startup sense of the word \"pivot\" had been invented\n\nyet, but we wanted to fund Steve and Alexis, so if their idea was\n\nbad, they'd have to work on something else. And I knew what else.\n\nIn those days there was a site called Delicious where you could\n\nsave links. It had a page called del.icio.us/popular that listed\n\nthe most-saved links, and people were using this page as a de facto\n\nReddit. I knew because a lot of the traffic to my site was coming\n\nfrom it. There needed to be something like del.icio.us/popular, but\n\ndesigned for sharing links instead of being a byproduct of saving\n\nthem.So I called Steve and Alexis and said that we liked them, just not\n\ntheir idea, so we'd fund them if they'd work on something else.\n\nThey were on the train home to Virginia at that point. They got off\n\nat the next station and got on the next train north, and by the end\n\nof the day were committed to working on what's now called Reddit.They would have liked to call it Snoo, as in \"What snoo?\" But\n\nsnoo.com was too expensive, so they settled for calling the mascot\n\nSnoo and picked a name for the site that wasn't registered. Early\n\non Reddit was just a provisional name, or so they told me at least,\n\nbut it's probably too late to change it now.As with all the really great startups, there's an uncannily close\n\nmatch between the company and the founders. Steve in particular.\n\nReddit has a certain personality — curious, skeptical, ready to\n\nbe amused — and that personality is Steve's.Steve will roll his eyes at this, but he's an intellectual; he's\n\ninterested in ideas for their own sake. That was how he came to be\n\nin that audience in Cambridge in the first place. He knew me because\n\nhe was interested in a programming language I've written about\n\ncalled Lisp, and Lisp is one of those languages few people learn\n\nexcept out of intellectual curiosity. Steve's kind of vacuum-cleaner\n\ncuriosity is exactly what you want when you're starting a site\n\nthat's a list of links to literally anything interesting.Steve was not a big fan of authority, so he also liked the idea of\n\na site without editors. In those days the top forum for programmers\n\nwas a site called Slashdot. It was a lot like Reddit, except the\n\nstories on the frontpage were chosen by human moderators. And though\n\nthey did a good job, that one small difference turned out to be a\n\nbig difference. Being driven by user submissions meant Reddit was\n\nfresher than Slashdot. News there was newer, and users will always\n\ngo where the newest news is.I pushed the Reddits to launch fast. A version one didn't need to\n\nbe more than a couple hundred lines of code. How could that take\n\nmore than a week or two to build? And they did launch comparatively\n\nfast, about three weeks into the first YC batch. The first users\n\nwere Steve, Alexis, me, and some of their YC batchmates and college\n\nfriends. It turns out you don't need that many users to collect a\n\ndecent list of interesting links, especially if you have multiple\n\naccounts per user.Reddit got two more people from their YC batch: Chris Slowe and\n\nAaron Swartz, and they too were unusually smart. Chris was just\n\nfinishing his PhD in physics at Harvard. Aaron was younger, a college\n\nfreshman, and even more anti-authority than Steve. It's not\n\nexaggerating to describe him as a martyr for what authority later\n\ndid to him.Slowly but inexorably Reddit's traffic grew. At first the numbers\n\nwere so small they were hard to distinguish from background noise.\n\nBut within a few weeks it was clear that there was a core of real\n\nusers returning regularly to the site. And although all kinds of\n\nthings have happened to Reddit the company in the years since,\n\nReddit the site never looked back.Reddit the site (and now app) is such a fundamentally useful thing\n\nthat it's almost unkillable. Which is why, despite a long stretch\n\nafter Steve left when the management strategy ranged from benign\n\nneglect to spectacular blunders, traffic just kept growing. You\n\ncan't do that with most companies. Most companies you take your eye\n\noff the ball for six months and you're in deep trouble. But Reddit\n\nwas special, and when Steve came back in 2015, I knew the world was\n\nin for a surprise.People thought they had Reddit's number: one of the players in\n\nSilicon Valley, but not one of the big ones. But those who knew\n\nwhat had been going on behind the scenes knew there was more to the\n\nstory than this. If Reddit could grow to the size it had with\n\nmanagement that was harmless at best, what could it do if Steve\n\ncame back? We now know the answer to that question. Or at least a\n\nlower bound on the answer. Steve is not out of ideas yet.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1152, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:25.316429Z"}
{"id": "google", "title": "How to Start Google", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/google.html", "date": "2024-03", "content": "March 2024(This is a talk I gave to 14 and 15 year olds about what to do now\n\nif they might want to start a startup later. Lots of schools think\n\nthey should tell students something about startups. This is what I\n\nthink they should tell them.)Most of you probably think that when you're released into the\n\nso-called real world you'll eventually have to get some kind of\n\njob. That's not true, and today I'm going to talk about a trick you\n\ncan use to avoid ever having to get a job.The trick is to start your own company. So it's not a trick for\n\navoiding work, because if you start your own company you'll\n\nwork harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you will\n\navoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, including\n\na boss telling you what to do.It's more exciting to work on your own project than someone else's.\n\nAnd you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standard\n\nway to get\n\nreally rich. If you look at the lists of the richest\n\npeople that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of\n\nthem did it by starting their own companies.Starting your own company can mean anything from starting a barber\n\nshop to starting Google. I'm here to talk about one extreme end of\n\nthat continuum. I'm going to tell you how to start Google.The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups\n\nwhen they're young. The reason I know about them is that my wife\n\nJessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically\n\na startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000\n\nstartups. So we know exactly what you need to start a startup,\n\nbecause we've helped people do it for the last 19 years.You might have thought I was joking when I said I was going to tell\n\nyou how to start Google. You might be thinking \"How could we\n\nstart Google?\" But that's effectively what the people who did start\n\nGoogle were thinking before they started it. If you'd told Larry\n\nPage and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, that the company they\n\nwere about to start would one day be worth over a trillion dollars,\n\ntheir heads would have exploded.All you can know when you start working on a startup is that it\n\nseems worth pursuing. You can't know whether it will turn into\n\na company worth billions or one that goes out of business. So when I\n\nsay I'm going to tell you how to start Google, I mean I'm going to\n\ntell you how to get to the point where you can start a company that\n\nhas as much chance of being Google as Google had of being Google.\n\n[1]How do you get from where you are now to the point where you can\n\nstart a successful startup? You need three things. You need to be\n\ngood at some kind of technology, you need an idea for what you're\n\ngoing to build, and you need cofounders to start the company with.How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which\n\ntechnology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have\n\nthe same answer: work on your own projects. Don't try to guess\n\nwhether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the\n\nmost valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that.\n\nJust work on whatever interests you the most. You'll work much\n\nharder on something you're interested in than something you're doing\n\nbecause you think you're supposed to.If you're not sure what technology to get good at, get good at\n\nprogramming. That has been the source of the median startup for the\n\nlast 30 years, and this is probably not going to change in the next\n\n10.Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may\n\nat this point be thinking, ok, we've got this sorted. We're already\n\nbeing taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough.\n\nYou have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff\n\nin classes. You can do well in computer science classes without\n\never really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a\n\ndegree in computer science from a top university and still not be\n\nany good at programming. That's why tech companies all make you\n\ntake a coding test before they'll hire you, regardless of where you\n\nwent to university or how well you did there. They know grades and\n\nexam results prove nothing.If you really want to learn to program, you have to work on your\n\nown projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you're\n\nwriting a game and there's something you want to do in it, and you\n\ndon't know how. You're going to figure out how a lot faster than\n\nyou'd learn anything in a class.You don't have to learn programming, though. If you're wondering\n\nwhat counts as technology, it includes practically everything you\n\ncould describe using the words \"make\" or \"build.\" So welding would\n\ncount, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you're most\n\ninterested in. The critical distinction is whether you're producing\n\nor just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing\n\nthem? That's the cutoff.Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager\n\nstudying calligraphy — the sort of beautiful writing that\n\nyou see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought\n\nthat this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because\n\nhe was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The\n\ncomputer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at\n\njust the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters\n\nlike the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking\n\nletters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at\n\nthis, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in\n\nthe computer business who really got graphic design.Don't feel like your projects have to be serious. They can\n\nbe as frivolous as you like, so long as you're building things\n\nyou're excited about. Probably 90% of programmers start out building\n\ngames. They and their friends like to play games. So they build\n\nthe kind of things they and their friends want. And that's exactly\n\nwhat you should be doing at 15 if you want to start a startup one\n\nday.You don't have to do just one project. In fact it's good to learn\n\nabout multiple things. Steve Jobs didn't just learn calligraphy.\n\nHe also learned about electronics, which was even more valuable.\n\nWhatever you're interested in. (Do you notice a theme here?)So that's the first of the three things you need, to get good at\n\nsome kind or kinds of technology. You do it the same way you get\n\ngood at the violin or football: practice. If you start a startup\n\nat 22, and you start writing your own programs now, then by the\n\ntime you start the company you'll have spent at least 7 years\n\npracticing writing code, and you can get pretty good at anything\n\nafter practicing it for 7 years.Let's suppose you're 22 and you've succeeded: You're now really\n\ngood at some technology. How do you get\n\nstartup ideas? It might\n\nseem like that's the hard part. Even if you are a good programmer,\n\nhow do you get the idea to start Google?Actually it's easy to get startup ideas once you're good at technology.\n\nOnce you're good at some technology, when you look at the world you\n\nsee dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You start\n\nto be able to see both the things that are missing from the technology\n\nitself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, and\n\neach one of these is a potential startup.In the town near our house there's a shop with a sign warning that\n\nthe door is hard to close. The sign has been there for several\n\nyears. To the people in the shop it must seem like this mysterious\n\nnatural phenomenon that the door sticks, and all they can do is put\n\nup a sign warning customers about it. But any carpenter looking at\n\nthis situation would think \"why don't you just plane off the part\n\nthat sticks?\"Once you're good at programming, all the missing software in the\n\nworld starts to become as obvious as a sticking door to a carpenter.\n\nI'll give you a real world example. Back in the 20th century,\n\nAmerican universities used to publish printed directories with all\n\nthe students' names and contact info. When I tell you what these\n\ndirectories were called, you'll know which startup I'm talking\n\nabout. They were called facebooks, because they usually had a picture\n\nof each student next to their name.So Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2002, and the university\n\nstill hasn't gotten the facebook online. Each individual house has\n\nan online facebook, but there isn't one for the whole university.\n\nThe university administration has been diligently having meetings\n\nabout this, and will probably have solved the problem in another\n\ndecade or so. Most of the students don't consciously notice that\n\nanything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at this\n\nsituation and thinks \"Well, this is stupid. I could write a program\n\nto fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photos\n\nand then combine the data into a new site for the whole university.\"\n\nSo he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands of\n\nusers.Of course Facebook was not a startup yet. It was just a... project.\n\nThere's that word again. Projects aren't just the best way to learn\n\nabout technology. They're also the best source of startup ideas.Facebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google also\n\nbegan as projects. Apple wasn't meant to be a company. Steve Wozniak\n\njust wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a company\n\nwhen Steve Jobs said \"Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for this\n\ncomputer to other people.\" That's how Apple started. They weren't\n\neven selling computers, just plans for computers. Can you imagine\n\nhow lame this company seemed?Ditto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren't trying to start a company\n\nat first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google,\n\nmost search engines didn't try to sort the results they gave you\n\nin order of importance. If you searched for \"rugby\" they just gave\n\nyou every web page that contained the word \"rugby.\" And the web was\n\nso small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might\n\nonly be 20 or 30 pages with the word \"rugby,\" but the web was growing\n\nexponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming\n\nexponentially more broken. Most users just thought, \"Wow, I sure\n\nhave to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.\"\n\nDoor sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. Like\n\nMark, they looked at this situation and thought \"Well, this is\n\nstupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others. Let's figure\n\nout which those are and show them first.\"It's obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup.\n\nIt wasn't obvious at the time. It's never obvious. If it was obviously\n\na good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would\n\nhave already done it. That's why the best startups grow out of\n\nprojects that aren't meant to be startups. You're not trying to\n\nstart a company. You're just following your instincts about what's\n\ninteresting. And if you're young and good at technology, then your\n\nunconscious instincts about what's interesting are better than your\n\nconscious ideas about what would be a good company.So it's critical, if you're a young founder, to build things for\n\nyourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders\n\nmake is to build something for some mysterious group of other people.\n\nBut if you can make something that you and your friends truly want\n\nto use — something your friends aren't just using out of\n\nloyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down\n\n— then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup\n\nidea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious\n\nhow to make money from it. But trust me, there's a way.What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something\n\nyour friends actually want. And those ideas aren't hard to see once\n\nyou're good at technology. There are sticking doors everywhere.\n\n[2]Now for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders.\n\nThe optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one or\n\ntwo cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I'm going\n\nto say next? It's the same thing: projects. You find cofounders by\n\nworking on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder is\n\nsomeone who's good at what they do and that you work well with, and\n\nthe only way to judge this is to work with them on things.At this point I'm going to tell you something you might not want\n\nto hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the\n\nones that are just memorization or blathering about literature,\n\nbecause you need to do well in your classes to get into a good\n\nuniversity. And if you want to start a startup you should try to\n\nget into the best university you can, because that's where the best\n\ncofounders are. It's also where the best employees are. When Larry\n\nand Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest\n\npeople they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for\n\nthem.The empirical evidence is clear on this. If you look at where the\n\nlargest numbers of successful startups come from, it's pretty much\n\nthe same as the list of the most selective universities.I don't think it's the prestigious names of these universities that\n\ncause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it's\n\nbecause the quality of the teaching is better. What's driving this\n\nis simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smart\n\nand determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manage\n\nto get in, you'll find the other students include a lot of smart\n\nand determined people.\n\n[3]You don't have to start a startup with someone you meet at university.\n\nThe founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of\n\nStripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But\n\nuniversities are the main source of cofounders. And because they're\n\nwhere the cofounders are, they're also where the ideas are, because\n\nthe best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who\n\nbecome your cofounders.So the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting a\n\nstartup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and the\n\nway to do that is to work on your own projects. And you need to do\n\nas well in school as you can, so you can get into a good university,\n\nbecause that's where the cofounders and the ideas are.That's it, just two things, build stuff and do well in school.Notes[1]\n\nThe rhetorical trick in this sentence is that the \"Google\"s\n\nrefer to different things. What I mean is: a company that has as\n\nmuch chance of growing as big as Google ultimately did as Larry and\n\nSergey could have reasonably expected Google itself would at the\n\ntime they started it. But I think the original version is zippier.[2]\n\nMaking something for your friends isn't the only source of\n\nstartup ideas. It's just the best source for young founders, who\n\nhave the least knowledge of what other people want, and whose own\n\nwants are most predictive of future demand.[3]\n\nStrangely enough this is particularly true in countries like\n\nthe US where undergraduate admissions are done badly. US admissions\n\ndepartments make applicants jump through a lot of arbitrary hoops\n\nthat have little to do with their intellectual ability. But the\n\nmore arbitrary a test, the more it becomes a test of mere determination\n\nand resourcefulness. And those are the two most important qualities\n\nin startup founders. So US admissions departments are better at\n\nselecting founders than they would be if they were better at selecting\n\nstudents.Thanks to Jared Friedman, Carolynn Levy, Jessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 2785, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:25.916584Z"}
{"id": "best", "title": "The Best Essay", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/best.html", "date": null, "content": "March 2024Despite its title this isn't meant to be the best essay. My goal\n\nhere is to figure out what the best essay would be like.It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic.\n\nWhat made it special would be what it was about.Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably\n\nwouldn't be about this year's lipstick colors. But it wouldn't be\n\nvaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be\n\nsurprising. It has to tell people something they don't already know.The best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell\n\npeople something surprising about.That may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences.\n\nOne is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping\n\ninto a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of\n\nnatural selection in an essay written in 1844.\n\nTalk about an\n\nimportant topic you could tell people something surprising about.\n\nIf that's the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one\n\nwritten in 1844.\n\nAnd indeed, the best possible essay at any given\n\ntime would usually be one describing the most important scientific\n\nor technological discovery it was possible to make.\n\n[1]Another unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing\n\nthis that the best essay would be fairly timeless — that the best\n\nessay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best\n\none you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true.\n\nIt might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this\n\nsense. But it wouldn't be impressive to write an essay introducing\n\nnatural selection now. The best essay now would be one describing\n\na great discovery we didn't yet know about.If the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to\n\nthe question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with\n\nthe wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we\n\nshouldn't waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making\n\ndiscoveries in some specific domain. But I'm interested in essays\n\nand what can be done with them, so I want to see if there's some\n\nother question I could have asked.There is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the\n\none I started with. Instead of asking what would the best essay\n\nbe? I should have asked how do you write essays well? Though\n\nthese seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer\n\nto the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay\n\nwriting. The second question forces it to be.Writing essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do\n\nyou do that well? How do you discover by writing?An essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a\n\nquestion, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't\n\nhave to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like\n\none in the sense that it spurs some response.How do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to\n\nchoose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it.\n\nProfessional traders won't even trade unless they have what they\n\ncall an edge — a convincing story about why in some class of\n\ntrades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't\n\nattack a topic unless you have a way in — some new insight about\n\nit or way of approaching it.You don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind\n\nof gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about\n\nsomething other people take for granted can be edge enough.If you come across a question that's sufficiently puzzling, it could\n\nbe worth exploring even if it doesn't seem very momentous. Many an\n\nimportant discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed\n\ninsignificant at first. How can they all be finches?\n\n[2]Once you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud\n\nabout it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific\n\nstring of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This\n\ninitial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts\n\nyour ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because\n\nonce you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.Perhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting\n\nwith something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because\n\nthis is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some\n\nspecific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's\n\nwrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay\n\nwriting is rereading what you've written and asking is this correct\n\nand complete? You have to be very strict when rereading, not just\n\nbecause you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between\n\nyour response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be\n\ndiscovered.The prize for being strict with what you've written is not just\n\nrefinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make\n\nit exactly right, sometimes you find that you can't, and that the\n\nreason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when\n\nyou discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different.\n\n[3]Ideally the response to a question is two things: the first step\n\nin a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional\n\nquestions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process\n\ncontinues recursively, as response spurs response.\n\n[4]Usually there are several possible responses to a question, which\n\nmeans you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped,\n\nwhich means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point.\n\nHow do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the\n\ngreatest combination of generality and novelty. I don't consciously\n\nrank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting;\n\nbut generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting.\n\n[5]If you're willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don't have to guess\n\nright. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it\n\nisn't good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time.\n\nIn this essay I've already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition\n\nto countless shorter ones. Maybe I'll reattach it at the end, or\n\nboil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we'll\n\nsee.\n\n[6]In general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous\n\ntemptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep\n\nsomething that isn't right, just because it contains a few good bits\n\nor cost you a lot of effort.The most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is\n\ndoes it really matter what the initial question is? If the space\n\nof ideas is highly connected, it shouldn't, because you should be\n\nable to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a few\n\nhops. And we see evidence that it's highly connected in the way,\n\nfor example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turn\n\nany conversation toward it. But that only works if you know where\n\nyou want to go, and you don't in an essay. That's the whole point.\n\nYou don't want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all your\n\nessays will be about the same thing.\n\n[7]The other reason the initial question matters is that you usually\n\nfeel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don't think about this when\n\nI decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality.\n\nSticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I've\n\nwandered too far and have to backtrack. But I think this is\n\nthe optimal solution. You don't want the hunt for novelty and\n\ngenerality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what\n\nyou get.\n\n[8]Since the initial question does constrain you, in the best case it\n\nsets an upper bound on the quality of essay you'll write. If you\n\ndo as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow\n\nfrom the initial question, the initial question itself is the only\n\nplace where there's room for variation.It would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though,\n\nbecause you can't predict where a question will lead. Not if you're\n\ndoing things right, because doing things right means making\n\ndiscoveries, and by definition you can't predict those. So the way\n\nto respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which\n\ninitial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays\n\nare for taking risks.Almost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took some\n\neffort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the third\n\nparagraph, because any essayist's first impulse on hearing that the\n\nbest essay couldn't be about x would be to try to write it. But if\n\nmost questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.Can we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering\n\nhow long I've been writing essays, it's alarming how novel that\n\nquestion feels.One thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love\n\nquestions that seem naughty in some way — for example, by seeming\n\ncounterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three.\n\nThis essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies there\n\nis such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive,\n\nthough it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essay\n\nbeing better than another. And thinking about how to do something\n\nso ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.I like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be just\n\na taste of mine, but there's one aspect of it that probably isn't:\n\nto write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested\n\nin it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretch\n\nfor the novel insights that are the raison d'etre of the essay, you\n\nhave to care.If caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question,\n\nthen the optimal question varies from person to person. It also\n\nmeans you're more likely to write great essays if you care about a\n\nlot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater the\n\nprobable overlap between the set of things you're curious about and\n\nthe set of topics that yield great essays.What other qualities would a great initial question have? It's\n\nprobably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas.\n\nAnd I find it's a good sign if it's one that people think has already\n\nbeen thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I've barely thought\n\nabout how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. I\n\nrarely choose what to write about; I just start thinking about\n\nsomething, and sometimes it turns into an essay.Am I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to be\n\nthinking about and instead start working my way through some\n\nsystematically generated list of topics? That doesn't sound like\n\nmuch fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initial\n\nquestion matters, I should care about it.Perhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whatever\n\npops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into your\n\nhead is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be the\n\nanswer, because a mere list of topics wouldn't be any use if you\n\ndidn't have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you\n\nneed a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't\n\ngenerate those systematically. If only.\n\n[9]You can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The\n\nquality of the ideas that come out of your head depends on what goes\n\nin, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.You can't learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning\n\nabout topics that are very different from one another. When I tell\n\npeople about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy\n\nbooks about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the\n\ntopics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps\n\nthat's actually optimal in this business.You can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building\n\nthings, and by going places and seeing things. I don't think it's\n\nimportant to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who\n\nmake you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an\n\nafternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart\n\npeople. I know because that's what a block of office hours at Y\n\nCombinator consists of.While breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes\n\nfrom doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have\n\nto solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing,\n\nI suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have\n\ndone, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other\n\nfields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your\n\ntime working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was\n\nhard.I'm not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to\n\nthose already doing it. If you've spent all your life so far working\n\non other things, you're already halfway there. Though of course to\n\nbe good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing\n\nyou'd probably have spent at least some time doing it.Everything I've said about initial questions applies also to the\n\nquestions you encounter in writing the essay. They're the same\n\nthing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just\n\nas every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any\n\ntechnique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good\n\nwhole essays.At some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels\n\nlike a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn't every\n\nanswer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you\n\nstart to feel sated. Once you've covered enough interesting ground,\n\nyou start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just\n\nas well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it's\n\nnot lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be\n\nasking the initial question of a new essay.That's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas:\n\nthe discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough\n\nstarting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. Though\n\nif you keep writing essays you'll gradually fix this problem by\n\nburning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of\n\nessays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.When a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You\n\ncan either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees\n\nend to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually\n\nit requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously\n\nat this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an\n\nexample of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that\n\nthe best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in the way the\n\nbest painting would. This seems surprising enough to be\n\nworth investigating further.There are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about\n\na matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect\n\non readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that\n\nlooked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us.\n\nBut with essays the two senses diverge, because essays\n\nteach, and you can't teach people something they already know.\n\nNatural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance,\n\nbut an essay explaining it couldn't have the same effect on us that\n\nit would have had on Darwin's contemporaries, precisely because his\n\nideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them.\n\n[10]I imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay\n\nwould be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would\n\ncontain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally to\n\nAristotle and Feynman. That doesn't seem to be true. But if the\n\nbest possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in this stricter\n\nsense, what would it take to write essays that were?The answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreen\n\nkind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that\n\nits discoveries aren't assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise\n\nthere will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers.\n\nIf you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as\n\nwell, you have to write essays that won't stick — essays that,\n\nno matter how good they are, won't become part of what people in\n\nthe future learn before they read them.\n\n[11]I can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about\n\nthings people never learn. For example, it's a long-established\n\npattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes,\n\nand only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them\n\nweren't worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you\n\ncan be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised\n\nby it.Ditto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo\n\nthings — of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions,\n\nfor example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn\n\nto avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless\n\ntopic.Sometimes when we're slow to grasp things it's not just because\n\nwe're obtuse or in denial but because we've been deliberately lied\n\nto. There are a lot of things adults lie\n\nto kids about, and when\n\nyou reach adulthood, they don't take you aside and hand you a list\n\nof them. They don't remember which lies they told you, and most\n\nwere implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a source\n\nof surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.Sometimes it's systems that lie to you. For example, the educational\n\nsystems in most countries train you to win by\n\nhacking the test. But\n\nthat's not how you win at the most important real-world tests, and\n\nafter decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the real\n\nworld to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies will\n\nwork as long as the institutions remain broken.\n\n[12]Another recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers\n\nalready know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted\n\nculturally. \"Everyone knows,\" for example, that it can be rewarding\n\nto have kids. But till you have them you don't know precisely what\n\nforms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never\n\nhave put into words.I've written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn't do it\n\nin a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in the\n\nstricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one's ideas\n\nnot sticking suggests that it's not worth making a deliberate attempt\n\nto. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, but\n\nif you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and future\n\ngenerations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much the\n\nbetter. You've crossed into Darwin territory.Writing about topics of timeless importance is an instance of\n\nsomething even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And\n\nthere are more kinds of breadth than chronological — applying to\n\nlots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate\n\naim.I already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I'm\n\nalways chasing. But I'm glad I understand where timelessness fits.I understand better where a lot of things fit now. This essay has\n\nbeen a kind of tour of essay writing. I started out hoping to get\n\nadvice about topics; if you assume good writing, the only thing\n\nleft to differentiate the best essay is its topic. And I did get\n\nadvice about topics: discover natural selection. Yeah, that would\n\nbe nice. But when you step back and ask what's the best you can do\n\nshort of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns\n\nout to be about procedure. Ultimately the quality of an essay is a\n\nfunction of the ideas discovered in it, and the way you get them\n\nis by casting a wide net for questions and then being very exacting\n\nwith the answers.The most striking feature of this map of essay writing are the\n\nalternating stripes of inspiration and effort required. The questions\n\ndepend on inspiration, but the answers can be got by sheer persistence.\n\nYou don't have to get an answer right the first time, but there's\n\nno excuse for not getting it right eventually, because you can keep\n\nrewriting till you do. And this is not just a theoretical possibility.\n\nIt's a pretty accurate description of the way I work. I'm rewriting\n\nas we speak.But although I wish I could say that writing great essays depends mostly\n\non effort, in the limit case it's inspiration that makes the\n\ndifference. In the limit case, the questions are the harder thing\n\nto get. That pool has no bottom.How to get more questions? That is the most important question of\n\nall.Notes[1]\n\nThere might be some resistance to this conclusion on the\n\ngrounds that some of these discoveries could only be understood by\n\na small number of readers. But you get into all sorts of difficulties\n\nif you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide\n\nwhere the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a\n\nhandful of people sequestered at Los Alamos,\n\ncould an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.Darwin's 1844 essay was derived from an earlier version written in 1839.\n\nExtracts from it were published in 1858.[2]\n\nWhen you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor\n\nquestion, that's an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to\n\npay attention to things that matter. So when you're very curious\n\nabout something random, that could mean you've unconsciously noticed\n\nit's less random than it seems.[3]\n\nCorollary: If you're not intellectually honest, your writing\n\nwon't just be biased, but also boring, because you'll miss all the\n\nideas you'd have discovered if you pushed for the truth.[4]\n\nSometimes this process begins before you start writing.\n\nSometimes you've already figured out the first few things you want\n\nto say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide everything\n\nthey want to say, and write this down as an outline before they\n\nstart writing the essay itself. Maybe that's a good way to get them\n\nstarted — or not, I don't know — but it's antithetical to the\n\nspirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less\n\nyour ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.[5]\n\nThe problem with this type of \"greedy\" algorithm is that you\n\ncan end up on a local maximum. If the most valuable question is\n\npreceded by a boring one, you'll overlook it. But I can't imagine\n\na better strategy. There's no lookahead except by writing. So use\n\na greedy algorithm and a lot of time.[6]\n\nI ended up reattaching the first 5 of the 17 paragraphs, and\n\ndiscarding the rest.[7]\n\nStephen Fry confessed to making use of this phenomenon when\n\ntaking exams at Oxford. He had in his head a standard essay about\n\nsome general literary topic, and he would find a way to turn the\n\nexam question toward it and then just reproduce it again.Strictly speaking it's the graph of ideas that would be highly\n\nconnected, not the space, but that usage would confuse people who\n\ndon't know graph theory, whereas people who do know it will get\n\nwhat I mean if I say \"space\".[8]\n\nToo far doesn't depend just on the distance from the original\n\ntopic. It's more like that distance divided by the value of whatever\n\nI've discovered in the subtree.[9]\n\nOr can you? I should try writing about this. Even if the\n\nchance of succeeding is small, the expected value is huge.[10]\n\nThere was a vogue in the 20th century for saying that the\n\npurpose of art was also to teach. Some artists tried to justify\n\ntheir work by explaining that their goal was not to produce something\n\ngood, but to challenge our preconceptions about art. And to be fair,\n\nart can teach somewhat. The ancient Greeks' naturalistic sculptures\n\nrepresented a new idea, and must have been extra exciting to\n\ncontemporaries on that account. But they still look good to us.[11]\n\nBertrand Russell caused huge controversy in the early 20th\n\ncentury with his ideas about \"trial marriage.\" But they make boring\n\nreading now, because they prevailed. \"Trial marriage\" is what we\n\ncall \"dating.\"[12]\n\nIf you'd asked me 10 years ago, I'd have predicted that schools\n\nwould continue to teach hacking the test for centuries. But now it\n\nseems plausible that students will soon be taught individually by\n\nAIs, and that exams will be replaced by ongoing, invisible\n\nmicro-assessments.Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell,\n\nJessica Livingston, Robert\n\nMorris, Courtenay Pipkin, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of\n\nthis.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 4266, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:26.522371Z"}
{"id": "superlinear", "title": "Superlinear Returns", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html", "date": null, "content": "October 2023One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world\n\nwhen I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance\n\nare superlinear.Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.\n\n\"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They\n\nmeant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half\n\nas good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers.\n\nYou get no customers, and you go out of business.It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear\n\nin business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if\n\nwe changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear\n\nreturns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact\n\nof rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power,\n\nmilitary victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all\n\nof these, the rich get richer.\n\n[1]You can't understand the world without understanding the concept\n\nof superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely\n\nshould, because this will be the wave you surf on.It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with\n\nsuperlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two\n\nfundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working\n\non something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial\n\ncultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're\n\ntricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone\n\nwho's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern\n\nthere. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And\n\nas a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies\n\nwith high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the\n\nones with lower growth rates may not even survive.Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather\n\nthan absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early\n\non, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them\n\ndecide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to\n\ntell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that\n\nby focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows\n\nexponentially.YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get\n\nout what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth. And if growth\n\nrate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance\n\np over time t would be proportional to pt.Even after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence\n\nstartling.Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll\n\nget exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare\n\nus for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is\n\nsurprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who\n\nasks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double\n\nthe amount each successive day.What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with,\n\nbut we don't have many customs about exponential growth either,\n\nbecause there have been so few instances of it in human history.\n\nIn principle herding should have been one: the more animals you\n\nhad, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land\n\nwas the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that\n\nexponentially.Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way\n\nto grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory\n\nyou control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier\n\nit is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of\n\nempires. But so few people created or ran empires that their\n\nexperiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a\n\nremote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use\n\nin one's own life.The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times\n\nwas probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to\n\nlearn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people\n\nwere startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain\n\ntopics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires\n\nof ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in\n\npreindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.\n\n[2]That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of\n\nideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But\n\nthis phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated\n\nit. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from\n\nexponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances\n\nof it.The other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression\n\n\"winner take all.\" In a sports match the relationship between\n\nperformance and return is a step function: the winning team gets\n\none win whether they do much better or just slightly better.\n\n[3]The source of the step function is not competition per se, however.\n\nIt's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need\n\ncompetition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations\n\nwhere you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting\n\na target.It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear\n\nreturns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential\n\ngrowth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage,\n\nwhich makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential\n\ngrowth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects,\n\na company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both\n\nsources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because\n\nexisting fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's\n\nso concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the\n\nA-list in the average person's head.The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns\n\nmay be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also\n\nthresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of\n\nthese thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read,\n\nyou're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important\n\nthresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge\n\nseems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the\n\nboundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole\n\nnew field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new\n\ndiscoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and\n\nDarwin.\n\nAre there general rules for finding situations with superlinear\n\nreturns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in\n\nthe sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in\n\nthe next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure,\n\nor growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching\n\nyou, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting\n\none because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You\n\nmay be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning\n\na lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People\n\nin Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only\n\ncontinue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But\n\nif you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't\n\ngrow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should\n\nyield results eventually.Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of\n\nlearning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably\n\ntreat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields\n\nanother heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning,\n\nyou're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.But don't overoptimize what you're learning. Don't limit yourself\n\nto learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're\n\nlearning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable,\n\nand if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the\n\nform \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situation\n\nis trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the\n\ngame will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette,\n\nyou'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the\n\nbest case you're no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarly\n\nuseless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently\n\nfast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of\n\nthe return curve — because something that grows fast enough will\n\ngrow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds\n\nonly guarantee the shape.\n\n[4]A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a\n\ntest to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if\n\nyou come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it\n\ncould be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes\n\na product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd\n\nbuy a better alternative if you made one.\n\n[5]It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual\n\nthresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new\n\nfields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty,\n\nbut the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have\n\npredictors that were even a little better than random, and there's\n\nhope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research\n\nproblem isn't likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems\n\nlegit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries\n\ntend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they\n\nwere mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open\n\nquestions with lots of people already working on them.) So one\n\nheuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism\n\n— to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what\n\nyou're supposed to.\n\nThe prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting\n\none for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department:\n\nthis territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types\n\nof work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns\n\nthemselves are growing.There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined\n\nthat they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and\n\nthe decreasing importance of organizations.Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an\n\norganization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to\n\nget the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and\n\nthe only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in\n\nmost cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And\n\nprestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of\n\nan organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a\n\nhandful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked\n\nalone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even\n\nthey were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.\n\n[6]A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns\n\nfor performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in\n\nmy lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists\n\nand writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious\n\nprojects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new\n\nways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change\n\nhas been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering\n\nwhat's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change\n\nthan one in the returns for performance.Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more\n\nvariation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better\n\noff: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly\n\nwill do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing\n\noneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people\n\nwill be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for\n\nsuperlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know\n\nthey're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher\n\nvariation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to\n\nrisk trying it to find out.\n\n[7]The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their\n\ncurrent inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they'd\n\nnever have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity\n\nwill be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural\n\nversion the institutions themselves might have cooked up.\n\nNot everyone is happy about this great unlocking of ambition. It\n\nthreatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies. [8]\n\nBut if you're an ambitious individual it's good news for you.\n\nHow should you take advantage of it?The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for\n\nperformance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of\n\nthe curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because\n\nthere's less competition at the far end — and not just for the\n\nobvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well,\n\nbut also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few\n\neven try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional\n\nwork, but a bargain even to try to.There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if\n\nyou want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right.\n\nFor example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be\n\ninterested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with\n\nsuperlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're\n\ninterested in, and to find ways to work on it.\n\n[9]\n\nIt will also be\n\nimportant to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example,\n\nif there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure\n\nof time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when\n\nyou're young and don't yet have children.There's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work.\n\nIt's not just a matter of trying hard. I'm going to take a shot\n\ngiving a recipe in one paragraph.Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in.\n\nDevelop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter\n\nwhat they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work\n\nas hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually\n\nbring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth\n\nfrom a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and\n\nexplore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole\n\nnew field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing\n\noccasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the\n\nbest colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples.\n\nBe honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep\n\nwell and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your\n\ncuriosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's\n\nworth paying attention to.\n\n[10]And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck\n\nis always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're\n\nworking on your own rather than as part of an organization. And\n\nthough there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where\n\npreparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component\n\nof true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is\n\nto take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking\n\nrisks early.\n\nThe best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably\n\nscience. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined\n\nwith thresholds at the extreme edge of performance — literally at\n\nthe limits of knowledge.The result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery\n\nthat makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies\n\nseem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater\n\nthan all his contemporaries' combined.\n\n[11]This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell\n\nit out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return\n\ncurve, the greater the variation in outcomes.In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality\n\nis so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of\n\nthis type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform\n\neveryone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same\n\nis unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else?\n\nHere are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting,\n\ndirecting, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing.\n\nIn sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds;\n\nyou only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In\n\npolitics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And\n\nin some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven\n\nlargely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth.\n\nBut when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a\n\nremarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same\n\nas the list of fields where you have to be independent-minded to\n\nsucceed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel\n\nas well.\n\n[12]This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers\n\nsaying things that other people have already said. But it's just\n\nas true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that\n\na company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone\n\nelse thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will\n\nalready reflect that, and there's no room to make money.What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have\n\nto put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at\n\nfirst. At this rate, you find yourself thinking, I'll never get\n\nanywhere. But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far\n\nend, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.In the startup world, the name for this principle is \"do things\n\nthat don't scale.\" If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to\n\nyour tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential\n\ngrowth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything\n\nthat grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first\n\nstart learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the\n\ninitial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the\n\neasier it will get.There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with\n\nsuperlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the\n\n20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a\n\nresult we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with\n\nhaving a job. Even now to most people the phrase \"your work\" means\n\ntheir job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever\n\nthey're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their\n\nwork is something they carry with them from job to job, if they\n\nhave jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of\n\ntheir portfolio.\n\nIt's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big\n\nwinners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately,\n\nbut you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and\n\nyou follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one.\n\nYour curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and\n\ninteresting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns\n\nif they're not already part of one.The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed,\n\nthe most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both\n\nambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity\n\nmay be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you\n\nclimb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting\n\nenough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.NotesThere's a limit to how sharply you can distinguish between effort,\n\nperformance, and return, because they're not sharply distinguished\n\nin fact. What counts as return to one person might be performance\n\nto another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry,\n\nthey're not meaningless. I've tried to write about them as precisely\n\nas I could without crossing into error.[1]\n\nEvolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of\n\nsuperlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to\n\nempathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns.[2]\n\nKnowledge did of course have a practical effect before the\n\nIndustrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human\n\nlife completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad,\n\ngradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few\n\nexceptionally learned people.[3]\n\nIt's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as\n\nsuperlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a\n\nsuperlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort\n\nby a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the\n\nstep is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after\n\nthe step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one\n\nwould bother.[4]\n\nSeeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that\n\nsome people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to\n\npromising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them\n\npromising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring\n\ncrowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by\n\nsomeone quietly working on another one.[5]\n\nNot always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When\n\nsomething is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden\n\nreason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete.\n\nPerhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for\n\ndeciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things\n\nthat exist for such reasons.[6]\n\nIn my twenties I wanted to be an artist\n\nand even went to art\n\nschool to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial\n\npart of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least\n\nat the mercy of organizations.[7]\n\nIn principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning\n\ncompounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in\n\npractice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where\n\nthe return curve gets really steep.[8]\n\nIt's unclear exactly what advocates of \"equity\" mean by it.\n\nThey seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is\n\nprobably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power\n\nto control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than\n\neveryone else.It may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just\n\nthe moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction,\n\nbut I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it\n\narose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly\n\nincreasing variation in performance.[9]\n\nCorollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something\n\nprestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in\n\nit, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.[10]\n\nThe original version of this paragraph was the first draft of\n\n\"How to Do Great Work.\"\n\nAs soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear\n\nreturns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its\n\nown. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because\n\nafter I finished \"How to Do Great Work\" I rewrote it based on that.[11]\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually\n\ndid it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful\n\nand enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist,\n\nby discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people\n\nwho get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most\n\nadvanced economies the ratio has shifted dramatically toward discovery\n\njust in the last half century.[12]\n\nIt's not surprising that conventional-minded people would\n\ndislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest\n\ndrivers of it. But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to\n\nhave what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine\n\nwhat it's like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great\n\nvariation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they\n\nencounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some\n\nmalign external influence.Thanks\n\nto Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Tyler Cowen,\n\nJessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts\n\nof this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 4195, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:27.264481Z"}
{"id": "greatwork", "title": "How to Do Great Work", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html", "date": null, "content": "July 2023If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot\n\nof different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided\n\nto find out by making it.Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone\n\nworking in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the\n\nintersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does\n\nhave a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled \"work hard.\"The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.\n\nThe first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose\n\nneeds to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a\n\nnatural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that\n\noffers scope to do great work.In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion.\n\nAmbitious people are if anything already too conservative about it.\n\nSo all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for\n\nand great interest in.\n\n[1]That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When\n\nyou're young you don't know what you're good at or what different\n\nkinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not\n\neven exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at\n\n14, most have to figure it out.The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not\n\nsure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going.\n\nYou'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's\n\ngood to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries\n\ncome from noticing connections between different fields.Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let \"work\"\n\nmean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do\n\ngreat work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.\n\nIt may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your\n\npart of it.What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly\n\nambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves,\n\nexciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly\n\nambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach\n\nyourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered\n\nquestions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the\n\nrudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let\n\nit have its way, will also show you what to work on.What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that\n\nwould bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the\n\nnext step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the\n\nfrontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a\n\ndistance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get\n\nclose to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because\n\nyour brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler\n\nmodel of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions\n\nabout things that everyone else took for granted.\n\n[2]If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often\n\nhas a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math.\n\nIt would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears,\n\nembrace it.Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested\n\nin them — in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited\n\nabout some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have\n\nenough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking,\n\nthat's as good a bet as you'll find.\n\n[3]Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier,\n\nnotice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone\n\nwho's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible\n\nto prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the\n\nempirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.\n\nThat's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply\n\ninterested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere\n\ndiligence ever could.The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the\n\ndesire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and\n\nthat combination is the most powerful of all.The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack\n\nin the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world\n\ninside.Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring\n\nout what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't\n\ntell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which\n\nmeans the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for\n\nyears before you know how much you like it or how good you are at\n\nit. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning\n\nabout, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose\n\nlate based on very incomplete information.\n\n[4]The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in\n\ntwo forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that\n\ngrows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the\n\nmore you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what\n\nto do.The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They\n\nexpect you to commit to a field long before you could know what\n\nit's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal\n\ntrajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted\n\nthat the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what\n\nto work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow\n\nmagically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will:\n\nwhen it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own.\n\nSome people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will\n\nfind themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on\n\nthe assumption that everyone does.What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know\n\nwhat to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively,\n\nassuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action.\n\nBut there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read\n\nbiographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how\n\nmuch luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result\n\nof a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.\n\nSo you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to\n\ndo that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people,\n\nread lots of books, ask lots of questions.\n\n[5]When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you\n\nlearn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very\n\ndifferent from what you do in high school math classes. So you need\n\nto give different types of work a chance to show you what they're\n\nlike. But a field should become increasingly interesting as you\n\nlearn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than\n\nother people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the\n\nbetter. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste\n\nfor work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find\n\nnew things if you're looking where few have looked before.One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like\n\neven the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the\n\ncourse of working on one thing you discover another that's more\n\nexciting, don't be afraid to switch.If you're making something for people, make sure it's something\n\nthey actually want. The best way to do this is to make something\n\nyou yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool\n\nyou want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests,\n\nthis will also get you your initial audience.This should follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most\n\nexciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason\n\nI mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong.\n\nInstead of making what they want, they try to make what some\n\nimaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down\n\nthat route, you're lost.\n\n[6]There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're\n\ntrying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion,\n\nfear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But\n\nif you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof\n\nagainst all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.\n\nFollowing your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy,\n\nbut in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of\n\nobstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it\n\ndoes take a good deal of boldness.But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning.\n\nIn most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard\n\non excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of\n\nit. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try\n\nto preserve certain invariants.The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements\n\nyou can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich\n\nby deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal,\n\nbut you can't discover natural selection that way.I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy\n\nis not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most\n\ninteresting and gives you the best options for the future. I call\n\nthis approach \"staying upwind.\" This is how most people who've done\n\ngreat work seem to have done it.\n\nEven when you've found something exciting to work on, working on\n\nit is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new\n\nidea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to\n\nwork. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't\n\nlike that.You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.\n\nThere are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a\n\ntechnique to working, just as there is to sailing.For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too\n\nhard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns:\n\nfatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health.\n\nThe point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the\n\ntype. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for\n\nfour or five hours a day.Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try\n\nto arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in.\n\nYou'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.\n\nYou'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial\n\nthreshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a\n\nflaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both\n\nper day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the\n\nsense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's\n\nok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over\n\nit.It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great\n\nwork, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't. When I'm\n\nreluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by\n\nsaying \"I'll just read over what I've got so far.\" Five minutes\n\nlater I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and\n\nI'm off.Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie\n\nto yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example.\n\nLots of great things began with someone saying \"How hard could it\n\nbe?\"This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more\n\noptimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism\n\nis ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be\n\nmore work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise\n\nin tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best\n\nwork happens in what was meant to be the final stage.Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what\n\nyou're working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you\n\ndiscover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after\n\nall.\n\n[7]\n\nSince there are two senses of starting work — per day and per\n\nproject — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project\n\nprocrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting\n\nthat ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't\n\nquite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can\n\nget a lot not done.\n\n[8]One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it\n\nusually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around\n\ndoing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So\n\nper-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day\n\nprocrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I\n\nworking on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok\n\nif the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous\n\nas you get older.\n\n[9]\n\nGreat work usually entails spending what would seem to most people\n\nan unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of\n\nthis time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the\n\nwork sufficiently engaging as it's happening.There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years\n\nat things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not\n\nhow great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently\n\non something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take\n\nstock, you're surprised how far you've come.The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative\n\neffect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but\n\nif you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key:\n\nconsistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every\n\nday. They get something done, rather than nothing.If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most\n\npeople who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to\n\nthink about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon:\n\nthe more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more.\n\nGrowing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more\n\nnew fans they'll bring you.The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat\n\nin the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential\n\ncurve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential\n\ngrowth in its early stages.Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's\n\nworth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since\n\nwe underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done\n\nunconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase\n\nof learning something new because they know from experience that\n\nlearning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their\n\naudience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do.\n\nIf people consciously realized they could invest in exponential\n\ngrowth, many more would do it.\n\nWork doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of\n\nundirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying\n\nin bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a\n\nlittle, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by\n\nfrontal attack.You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this\n\nphenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The\n\ndaydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds\n\nit questions.\n\n[10]Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important\n\nto avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your\n\nmind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that\n\nmoment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out\n\nof the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on\n\nthe distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)\n\nConsciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field.\n\nUntil you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't\n\nknow what you're aiming for.And that is what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to\n\nbe the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made\n\nby so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth\n\nthinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a\n\nphenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where\n\nalmost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short.\n\nOr it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively\n\ndifferent thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is\n\nsimply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.\n\n[11]Fortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might\n\nseem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the\n\nbest, in practice you often end up net ahead. It's exciting, and\n\nalso strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it's\n\neasier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will\n\ncare about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter\n\nmore than your contemporaries', but because something that still\n\nseems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.\n\nDon't try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best\n\njob you can; you won't be able to help doing it in a distinctive\n\nway.Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying\n\nto is affectation.Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is\n\ndoing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while\n\nyou're pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows\n\nin the work.\n\n[12]The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They\n\noften feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that\n\nproblem, because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently\n\nambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're\n\nnot a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work and\n\nyour identity will take care of itself.\n\n\"Avoid affectation\" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how\n\nwould you express this idea positively? How would you say what to\n\nbe, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're\n\nearnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar\n\nvices.The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're\n\ntaught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind\n\nof sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new\n\nideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're\n\ntrying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can\n\nyou have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight\n\npositive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing\n\nto admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken\n\nabout something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it.\n\n[13]Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality.\n\nInformality is much more important than its grammatically negative\n\nname implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means\n\nfocusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as\n\ndoing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing\n\nit. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being\n\ngood. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work:\n\nthey expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's\n\nbasically the definition of a nerd.Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need\n\nin doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood.\n\nSo hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than\n\nthe one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms\n\nof them. \"It's easy to criticize\" is true in the most literal sense,\n\nand the route to great work is never easy.There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and\n\npessimistic, but if you want to do great work it's an advantage to\n\nbe optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a\n\nfool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The\n\nOld Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a\n\nfool. But that's advice for seeming smart. If you actually want\n\nto discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling\n\npeople your ideas.Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a\n\nconscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I\n\ndoubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest.\n\nIt's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin\n\nfor error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected,\n\nintellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool.\n\n[14]\n\nGreat work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself.\n\nIt's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle\n\nof working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily\n\nhave to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some\n\neffort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias\n\nand laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat\n\nthis ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert\n\nto what I have now?Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit\n\njust because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of\n\neffort.Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're\n\ndoing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll\n\nunderstand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about\n\nwhether there's anything real there.Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from\n\nthe arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term \"elegant\"\n\napplied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior —\n\nthat the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical\n\nelegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math.Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will\n\noften have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of\n\neffort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people,\n\nat least temporarily.Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively\n\nlittle effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn't\n\nhave to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard\n\nto say whether you're creating something or discovering it.When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or\n\ndiscovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself\n\nas a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem\n\nto work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case\n\nit's more like creating something. In the best case you create the\n\nfield in the process of exploring it.)Similarly, if you're trying to build a powerful tool, make it\n\ngratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition\n\nwill be used in ways you didn't expect, so err on the side of\n\neliminating restrictions, even if you don't know what the benefit\n\nwill be.Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something\n\nothers build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that\n\nothers could use, or exposing questions that others could answer.\n\nThe best ideas have implications in many different areas.If you express your ideas in the most general form, they'll be truer\n\nthan you intended.\n\nTrue by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be\n\ntrue and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new\n\nideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers\n\nof knowledge.In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity,\n\nand imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name,\n\nbecause it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible\n\nto have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great\n\ndeal of what's often called technical ability — and yet not have\n\nmuch of this.I've never liked the term \"creative process.\" It seems misleading.\n\nOriginality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers\n\nthrow off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle\n\ngrinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand\n\nvery well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most\n\noriginal thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got\n\ndivorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15\n\nyear old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see\n\noriginality separated from expertise like that made its nature all\n\nthe more clear.I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there\n\nare definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For\n\nexample, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're\n\nworking on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have\n\noriginal ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something\n\nslightly too difficult.\n\n[15]Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good\n\nway to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a\n\nmissing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you.\n\nIndeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll\n\noften find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often\n\ndislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit.\n\nSometimes it's enough just to go for a walk.\n\n[16]It also helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas\n\nif you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives\n\nthe angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because\n\nanalogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.Don't divide your attention evenly between many topics though,\n\nor you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it\n\naccording to something more like a power law.\n\n[17]\n\nBe professionally\n\ncurious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds\n\noriginality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship\n\nis closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality;\n\nit's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since\n\nquestions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity\n\nat its best is a creative force.\n\nHaving new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of\n\nseeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a\n\nnew idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this\n\nbefore?When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably\n\na good one.Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having\n\nnew ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction?\n\nIt's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the\n\nway you look at the world. We see the world through models that\n\nboth help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas\n\nbecome obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard.\n\nThat's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover:\n\nthey're easy to see after you do something hard.One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other\n\npeople. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where\n\nthey bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these\n\nclues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached\n\nto their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend\n\nto ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous\n\nit may seem in retrospect.To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead\n\nof looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the\n\nwild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was\n\nlooking for new ideas as because he was stricter.The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical\n\nas it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps\n\nto be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the\n\npoint of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially\n\nshares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new\n\nideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem\n\nperfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world\n\nthey brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the\n\ngreater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally\n\naccepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to\n\nmost people, or someone would have already explored it. So what\n\nyou're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of\n\ncrazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often\n\nideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of\n\ncrazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas\n\nideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy\n\nbreaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases\n\nbeing aggressively and passively independent-minded.The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules\n\ndon't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional\n\nenergy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of\n\na project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it\n\nstarted.The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps\n\neven to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often\n\nmake new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts\n\nas a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies\n\nalso seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs.\n\nSeveral I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination.\n\nIn popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken\n\nmodel in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial\n\nones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking are\n\nopposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers\n\ncan be truly strict.\n\nAn overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do\n\nsee it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious\n\nshoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much\n\nwork, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if\n\nyou could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for someone\n\nelse to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to\n\nprotect you.You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other\n\ndirection: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished\n\nbut mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable\n\nideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So\n\nanything that can be described either literally or metaphorically\n\nas a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow.\n\nCopernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.\n\n[18]What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being\n\ntoo attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident\n\nas they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?\n\nPeople show much more originality in solving problems than in\n\ndeciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly\n\nconservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream\n\nof being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on\n\nfashionable problems.One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than\n\nsolutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy\n\nyou for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But\n\neven so I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely\n\nresponding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems\n\nare undervalued.One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the\n\nproblem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't.\n\nGreat work often takes something that already exists and shows its\n\nlatent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're\n\ninterested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let\n\ntheir skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's\n\nno hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied\n\nelsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And\n\nthere's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that\n\nwould otherwise be wasted.But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly\n\nunfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't\n\nseem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these?\n\nBy being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way,\n\nand tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head\n\nthat says you should only be working on \"important\" problems.You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is\n\ntoo conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important\n\nbut overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already\n\non your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you\n\nwere going to take a break from \"serious\" work to work on something\n\njust because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The\n\nanswer is probably more important than it seems.Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than\n\noriginality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people\n\nwho discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the\n\ninitial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key\n\nto the whole game.\n\nFew grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas\n\nis about the ratio of question to answer in their composition.\n\nPeople think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was\n\nin the question.Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used\n\nin schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being\n\nanswered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can\n\nbe much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery.\n\nHow do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to\n\nearth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By\n\neven asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel\n\nterritory.Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around\n\nwith you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of\n\nnoticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing\n\nthat two unanswered questions are the same.Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often\n\ncomes from returning to a question you first noticed years before\n\n— in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about.\n\nPeople talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful\n\ndreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful\n\nquestions alive.\n\n[19]This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from\n\nthe popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are\n\ncertain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long\n\nas (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else\n\nunderstands them either.Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea\n\nis discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled\n\nabout something. Which means that originality consists partly of\n\npuzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with\n\nthe world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them,\n\nbut not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them.\n\n[20]It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is\n\none of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best\n\nway to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones.\n\nQuestions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.\n\nThe best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread\n\nprotruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it\n\njust gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be\n\nobviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict\n\nthat. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to\n\npredict how much will unravel if you pull on it.It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on\n\na lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The\n\ninitial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side\n\nprojects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start\n\nlots of small things.Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try,\n\nthe greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand,\n\nthough, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things\n\nthat don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also\n\nhaving a lot of bad ones.\n\n[21]Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything\n\nthat's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by\n\ntrying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you\n\ndo look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when\n\nstarting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like\n\ntwo puzzle pieces.How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By\n\nmaking successive versions. Great things are almost always made in\n\nsuccessive versions. You start with something small and evolve it,\n\nand the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than\n\nanything you could have planned.It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're\n\nmaking something for people — to get an initial version in front\n\nof them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work.\n\nSurprisingly often, it does. If it doesn't, this will at least get\n\nyou started.Don't try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There\n\nare names for doing this with the first version (taking too long\n\nto ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are\n\nboth merely instances of a more general principle.An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a\n\ntoy. It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has\n\neverything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow.\n\n[22]The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it\n\nis to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does\n\nusually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized\n\nto say \"we're going to do x and then y and then z\" than \"we're going\n\nto try x and see what happens.\" And it is more organized; it just\n\ndoesn't work as well.Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a\n\nnecessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something\n\nyou have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or\n\nbecause you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If\n\nyou keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to\n\nplan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.\n\nTake as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk\n\nis proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a\n\nbet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally,\n\nyou're probably being too conservative.Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the\n\nyoung who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear\n\nrisk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most.Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working\n\non it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and\n\nencountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably\n\nno better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying\n\nto do something slightly too hard.\n\nUse the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages\n\nof age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy,\n\ntime, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge,\n\nefficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of\n\nthe latter when young and keep some of the former when old.The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they\n\nhave. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest\n\nis probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time.\n\nThe best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly\n\nfrivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know\n\nabout, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just\n\nbecause it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.That \"slightly\" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly\n\nwhen you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference\n\nbetween doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing\n\nsomething you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet,\n\nand possibly a better one than you think.\n\n[23]The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience,\n\nis that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain\n\nembraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit\n\ntogether perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but\n\noccasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly\n\nand jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the\n\nidea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not\n\nto.\n\n[24]So when you're learning about something for the first time, pay\n\nattention to things that seem wrong or missing. You'll be tempted\n\nto ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you.\n\nAnd you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep\n\nprogressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further\n\ninto the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If\n\nthey're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they\n\nprobably represent an undiscovered idea.\n\nOne of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience\n\nis to know what you don't have to worry about. The young know all\n\nthe things that could matter, but not their relative importance.\n\nSo they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much\n\nmore about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience.\n\nThe other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at\n\nadulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you've\n\nacquired and false things you've been taught — and you won't be\n\nable to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in\n\nthe way of whatever type of work you want to do.Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools.\n\nWe're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school\n\nas identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of\n\nstrange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child,\n\nthere was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you\n\nwhat you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither\n\nclasses nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts\n\nof the way schools are usually designed.The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still\n\nin school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your\n\nteachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem\n\na stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's\n\nthe truth economically, and in the best case it's the truth\n\nintellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your\n\nbosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source\n\nof advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like.\n\nIn school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost\n\nalways soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In\n\nreal life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you\n\noften don't know if they're soluble at all.But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win\n\nby hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You\n\ncan't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way\n\nto beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others\n\nhave overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.\n\nDon't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you\n\na \"big break.\" Even if this were true, the best way to get it would\n\nbe to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential\n\npeople.And don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that\n\nimpress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different\n\nfrom those required to do great work. The decisions of selection\n\ncommittees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of\n\na feedback loop, and very few are.\n\nPeople new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing\n\ninherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how\n\nsomething works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does\n\ncopying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the\n\npresence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy\n\nsomething, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still,\n\nunconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed\n\nphrase \"Great artists steal.\" The really dangerous kind of copying,\n\nthe kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done\n\nwithout realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train\n\nrunning on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other\n\nextreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.\n\n[25]In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be\n\nin some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a\n\nvacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're\n\nfirst starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're\n\ngoing to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once\n\nyou're established, you can react to your own. But while the former\n\ngets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two\n\ncases are more similar than they seem.Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes\n\nmakes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New\n\ndiscoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of\n\nexisting things, even by their discoverers, because there isn't\n\nyet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that\n\nyou'll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at\n\nthe frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.And when you do copy something, don't copy every feature of it.\n\nSome will make you ridiculous if you do. Don't copy the manner of\n\nan eminent 50 year old professor if you're 18, for example, or the\n\nidiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded\n\ndespite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the\n\nmost likely to be the flaws.This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are\n\njerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that\n\nbeing a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented\n\nis merely how they get away with it.One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from\n\none field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries\n\nof this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by\n\ndeliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas\n\nfrom quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you\n\ncan sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things\n\ndone well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's\n\nmissing.\n\nIf a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one\n\nplace, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will\n\nincrease your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people\n\nare human, increase your self-confidence.\n\n[26]If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you\n\nmight expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy\n\nto talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're\n\nreally good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's\n\ninterest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their\n\nhobbies.It may take some effort to find the people who are really good,\n\nthough. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places,\n\nparticularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone\n\nis engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities\n\ncan't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in\n\ndifferent departments varies immensely. Some departments have people\n\ndoing great work; others have in the past; others never have.\n\nSeek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't\n\nbe done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's\n\ngood to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect\n\nyou. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better\n\nto have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good\n\nones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from\n\nhistory: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests\n\nthat one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great\n\nwork and not.How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my\n\nexperience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure,\n\nyou probably don't. But it may be possible to give a more concrete\n\nanswer than that. Here's an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues\n\noffer surprising insights. They can see and do things that you\n\ncan't. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep\n\nyou on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some\n\nprojects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those\n\nis not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you'll\n\nhave to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and\n\ninterest like any other kind of work. If you don't have them, there\n\nis no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management\n\nas a second language, or avoid such projects.\n\n[27]\n\nHusband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working\n\non ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a\n\nliving organism.Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great\n\nwork if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of\n\nyourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If\n\nyou choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a\n\nrefuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism,\n\nit's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by\n\nsome of the greatest minds in history.Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which\n\nincreases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this\n\ncycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing\n\ngood work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since\n\nit matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right\n\ndirection, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when\n\nyou're stuck, just so you start to get something done.One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow\n\nsetbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.\n\nYou can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering\n\nsetbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always\n\ninvolves some backtracking.Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the\n\ndesire to. So \"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again\" isn't\n\nquite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either\n\ntry again, or backtrack and then try again.\"Never give up\" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times\n\nwhen it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would\n\nbe: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you\n\nneed to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more\n\nthan it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends\n\nhow fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from\n\nbad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.\n\nAn audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar,\n\nyour audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience\n\nin the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big.\n\nThe value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with\n\nits size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if\n\nyou're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated\n\naudience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people\n\ngenuinely love what you're doing, that's enough.To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between\n\nyou and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable,\n\nbut it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off\n\nswitching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.\n\n[28]The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your\n\nmorale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and\n\nothers who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always\n\nwhat you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and\n\navoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there's someone\n\nyou need to take care of, that takes precedence.Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work,\n\nor sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're\n\nambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition;\n\nso someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you,\n\nor does and doesn't care.Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's\n\nimportant to take care of it. That means exercising regularly,\n\neating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of\n\ndrugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise\n\nbecause they're good for thinking.\n\n[29]People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone\n\nelse, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. In fact,\n\nif you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous not to be productive.\n\nPeople who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to\n\nbecome bitter.\n\nIt's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people.\n\nThe opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the\n\nopinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just\n\nadds noise.The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and\n\nsometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough,\n\nyou'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of\n\nwork is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose\n\nthe problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing\n\nsomething just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors\n\nmake you do anything much more specific than work harder.Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows\n\nmore than you do about what's worth paying attention to.\n\nNotice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the\n\nsecret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single\n\nword, my bet would be on \"curiosity.\"That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to\n\nbe curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can\n\nnurture it and let it drive you.Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will\n\nchoose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to\n\nnotice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole\n\nprocess is a kind of dance with curiosity.\n\nBelieve it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could.\n\nBut its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it\n\nthis far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so\n\nyou're already further along than you might realize, because the\n\nset of people willing to want to is small.The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal,\n\nmathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and\n\nluck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can\n\nignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to\n\ndo great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest.\n\nCan you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will\n\ncombine to yield an explosion of new ideas?Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different\n\nways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered.\n\nOut of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited\n\nfor is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close\n\nmatch. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your\n\nability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by\n\ntrying.Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds\n\nthem back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous\n\nto try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if\n\nyou tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation\n\nis rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do\n\ngreat work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy\n\naway from the question.So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great\n\nwork, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that.\n\nI wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know\n\nyou're interested.Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone.\n\nAnd if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have\n\nworse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst\n\nproblem you have.Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to\n\nwork hard. And if you're working on something you find very\n\ninteresting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path,\n\nthe work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your\n\npeers'.The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?\n\nNotes[1]\n\nI don't think you could give a precise definition of what\n\ncounts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important\n\nso well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But\n\nthere's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree, and\n\noften hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused\n\non developing their interests rather than worrying about whether\n\nthey're important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and\n\nleave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.[2]\n\nA lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in\n\neveryday life. \"Did you ever notice...?\" New ideas come from doing\n\nthis about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people's\n\nreaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha![3]\n\nThat second qualifier is critical. If you're excited about\n\nsomething most authorities discount, but you can't give a more\n\nprecise explanation than \"they don't get it,\" then you're starting\n\nto drift into the territory of cranks.[4]\n\nFinding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding\n\na match between the current version of you and a list of known\n\nproblems. You'll often have to coevolve with the problem. That's\n\nwhy it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The\n\nsearch space is huge. It's the cartesian product of all possible\n\ntypes of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible\n\nfuture versions of you.There's no way you could search this whole space, so you have to\n\nrely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope\n\nthe best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be;\n\ndifferent types of work have been collected together as much by\n\naccidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.[5]\n\nThere are many reasons curious people are more likely to do\n\ngreat work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide\n\nnet, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in the\n\nfirst place.[6]\n\nIt can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you\n\nfeel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk\n\ndown to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it\n\nin a sufficiently cynical way, but it's not the route to great work.\n\nNot that anyone using this m.o. would care.[7]\n\nThis idea I learned from Hardy's A Mathematician's Apology,\n\nwhich I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any\n\nfield.[8]\n\nJust as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate\n\nwhat we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done\n\nby procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by\n\nprocrastinating for several years.[9]\n\nYou can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want,\n\nespecially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work\n\nclose to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for\n\ndoing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side.\n\nBoth can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your\n\nwork is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight\n\nto get time to do it.[10]\n\nIf you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax\n\ncycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and\n\nthat you walk to and from.[11]\n\nThere may be some very unworldly people who do great work\n\nwithout consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to\n\ncover that case, it becomes: Don't try to be anything except the\n\nbest.[12]\n\nThis gets more complicated in work like acting, where the\n\ngoal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it's possible to be\n\naffected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid\n\nunintentional affectation.[13]\n\nIt's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable\n\nif and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe\n\nto have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under\n\nthe law, because a sentence with a \"should\" in it isn't really a\n\nstatement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And\n\nif there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles,\n\nthere can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve\n\nit.[14]\n\nAffectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty.\n\nAffectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in\n\ntime, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.[15]\n\nObviously you don't have to be working at the exact moment\n\nyou have the idea, but you'll probably have been working fairly\n\nrecently.[16]\n\nSome say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I'm\n\nskeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.[17]\n\nFor example you might give the nth most important topic\n\n(m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m > 1. You couldn't allocate\n\nyour attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an\n\nidea of a reasonable distribution.[18]\n\nThe principles defining a religion have to be mistaken.\n\nOtherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to\n\ndistinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.[19]\n\nIt might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of\n\nquestions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you're\n\nnow in a position to do something about some of them.[20]\n\nThe connection between originality and uncertainty causes a\n\nstrange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain\n\nthan the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand\n\nin disputes, even though they're generally stupider.\n\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\n\nAre full of passionate intensity.\n\n[21]\n\nDerived from Linus Pauling's \"If you want to have good ideas,\n\nyou must have many ideas.\"[22]\n\nAttacking a project as a \"toy\" is similar to attacking a\n\nstatement as \"inappropriate.\" It means that no more substantial\n\ncriticism can be made to stick.[23]\n\nOne way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if\n\nyou're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely\n\nto be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where\n\nyou create something is less likely to be a waste of time than\n\nplaying games where you don't.[24]\n\nAnother related advantage is that if you haven't said anything\n\npublicly yet, you won't be biased toward evidence that supports\n\nyour earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve\n\neternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people,\n\nhaving previously published opinions has an effect similar to\n\nideology, just in quantity 1.[25]\n\nIn the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta\n\nMaria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted\n\nhis own version to show how much better he was.[26]\n\nI'm being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of\n\nthis writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that\n\nare hard to duplicate, but that could change.[27]\n\nThis is false when the work the other people have to do is\n\nvery constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible\n\nto expand the area in which it's false by defining similarly\n\nrestricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.[28]\n\nCorollary: Building something that enables people to go around\n\nintermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably\n\na good idea.[29]\n\nIt may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because\n\nthat frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and\n\nthere is some historical evidence for it.Thanks\n\nto Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Pam Graham, Tom Howard,\n\nPatrick Hsu, Steve Huffman, Jessica Livingston, Henry Lloyd-Baker,\n\nBob Metcalfe, Ben Miller, Robert Morris, Michael Nielsen, Courtenay\n\nPipkin, Joris Poort, Mieke Roos, Rajat Suri, Harj Taggar, Garry\n\nTan, and my younger son for suggestions and for reading drafts.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 11619, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:27.963911Z"}

Not just\n\nbecause it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but\n\nbecause even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about\n\nx doesn't just teach you about x; it also teaches you how to write.\n\n[1]Would that matter? If we replaced reading, would anyone need to be\n\ngood at writing?The reason it would matter is that writing is not just a way to\n\nconvey ideas, but also a way to have them.A good writer doesn't just think, and then write down what he\n\nthought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always\n\ndiscover new things in the process of writing. And there is, as far\n\nas I know, no substitute for this kind of discovery. Talking about\n\nyour ideas with other people is a good way to develop them. But\n\neven after doing this, you'll find you still discover new things\n\nwhen you sit down to write. There is a kind of thinking that can\n\nonly be done by writing.There are of course kinds of thinking that can be done without\n\nwriting. If you don't need to go too deeply into a problem, you can\n\nsolve it without writing. If you're thinking about how two pieces\n\nof machinery should fit together, writing about it probably won't\n\nhelp much. And when a problem can be described formally, you can\n\nsometimes solve it in your head. But if you need to solve a\n\ncomplicated, ill-defined problem, it will almost always help to\n\nwrite about it. Which in turn means that someone who's not good at\n\nwriting will almost always be at a disadvantage in solving such\n\nproblems.You can't think well without writing well, and you can't write well\n\nwithout reading well. And I mean that last \"well\" in both senses.\n\nYou have to be good at reading, and read good things.\n\n[2]People who just want information may find other ways to get it.\n\nBut people who want to have ideas can't afford to.Notes[1]\n\nAudiobooks can give you examples of good writing, but having\n\nthem read to you doesn't teach you as much about writing as reading\n\nthem yourself.[2]\n\nBy \"good at reading\" I don't mean good at the mechanics of\n\nreading. You don't have to be good at extracting words from the\n\npage so much as extracting meaning from the words.Japanese TranslationChinese TranslationItalian TranslationFrench Translation", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 439, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:29.165189Z"}

At the\n\ntime I had a self-interested motive for exploring the question. At\n\nthat age (like most succeeding ages) I was always in trouble with\n\nthe authorities, and it seemed to me that there might possibly be\n\nsome way to get out of trouble by arguing that I wasn't responsible\n\nfor my actions. I gradually lost hope of that, but the puzzle\n\nremained: How do you reconcile being a machine made of matter with\n\nthe feeling that you're free to choose what you do?\n\n[1]The best way to explain the answer may be to start with a slightly\n\nwrong version, and then fix it. The wrong version is: You can do\n\nwhat you want, but you can't want what you want. Yes, you can control\n\nwhat you do, but you'll do what you want, and you can't control\n\nthat.The reason this is mistaken is that people do sometimes change what\n\nthey want. People who don't want to want something — drug addicts,\n\nfor example — can sometimes make themselves stop wanting it. And\n\npeople who want to want something — who want to like classical\n\nmusic, or broccoli — sometimes succeed.So we modify our initial statement: You can do what you want, but\n\nyou can't want to want what you want.That's still not quite true. It's possible to change what you want\n\nto want. I can imagine someone saying \"I decided to stop wanting\n\nto like classical music.\" But we're getting closer to the truth.\n\nIt's rare for people to change what they want to want, and the more\n\n\"want to\"s we add, the rarer it gets.We can get arbitrarily close to a true statement by adding more \"want\n\nto\"s in much the same way we can get arbitrarily close to 1 by adding\n\nmore 9s to a string of 9s following a decimal point. In practice\n\nthree or four \"want to\"s must surely be enough. It's hard even to\n\nenvision what it would mean to change what you want to want to want\n\nto want, let alone actually do it.So one way to express the correct answer is to use a regular\n\nexpression. You can do what you want, but there's some statement\n\nof the form \"you can't (want to)* want what you want\" that's true.\n\nUltimately you get back to a want that you don't control.\n\n[2]\n\nNotes[1]\n\nI didn't know when I was 9 that matter might behave randomly,\n\nbut I don't think it affects the problem much. Randomness destroys\n\nthe ghost in the machine as effectively as determinism.[2]\n\nIf you don't like using an expression, you can make the same\n\npoint using higher-order desires: There is some n such that you\n\ndon't control your nth-order desires.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 486, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:29.801572Z"}
{"id": "alien", "title": "Alien Truth", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/alien.html", "date": null, "content": "October 2022If there were intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, they'd\n\nshare certain truths in common with us. The truths of mathematics\n\nwould be the same, because they're true by definition. Ditto for\n\nthe truths of physics; the mass of a carbon atom would be the same\n\non their planet. But I think we'd share other truths with aliens\n\nbesides the truths of math and physics, and that it would be\n\nworthwhile to think about what these might be.For example, I think we'd share the principle that a controlled\n\nexperiment testing some hypothesis entitles us to have proportionally\n\nincreased belief in it. It seems fairly likely, too, that it would\n\nbe true for aliens that one can get better at something by practicing.\n\nWe'd probably share Occam's razor. There doesn't seem anything\n\nspecifically human about any of these ideas.We can only guess, of course. We can't say for sure what forms\n\nintelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that\n\nquestion, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien\n\ntruth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms\n\nintelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or\n\nmore precisely a target, for truth. If you're trying to find the\n\nmost general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably\n\nthey'll be those we'd share in common with other forms of intelligent\n\nlife.Alien truth will work best as a heuristic if we err on the side of\n\ngenerosity. If an idea might plausibly be relevant to aliens, that's\n\nenough. Justice, for example. I wouldn't want to bet that all\n\nintelligent beings would understand the concept of justice, but I\n\nwouldn't want to bet against it either.The idea of alien truth is related to Erdos's idea of God's book.\n\nHe used to describe a particularly good proof as being in God's\n\nbook, the implication being (a) that a sufficiently good proof was\n\nmore discovered than invented, and (b) that its goodness would be\n\nuniversally recognized. If there's such a thing as alien truth,\n\nthen there's more in God's book than math.What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice\n\nis \"philosophy.\" Whatever else philosophy includes, it should\n\nprobably include this. I'm fairly sure Aristotle would have thought\n\nso. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth\n\nis, if not an accurate description of philosophy, a good\n\ndefinition for it. I.e. that it's what people who call\n\nthemselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currently\n\nare. But I'm not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not what\n\nwe call it.We may one day have something like alien life among us in the form\n\nof AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about what\n\ntruths an intelligent being would have to share with us. We might\n\nfind, for example, that it's impossible to create something we'd\n\nconsider intelligent that doesn't use Occam's razor. We might one\n\nday even be able to prove that. But though this sort of research\n\nwould be very interesting, it's not necessary for our purposes, or\n\neven the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we're going to call it that, would be\n\nto see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target,\n\nnot to say precisely where the threshold of it is. Those two questions might one\n\nday converge, but they'll converge from quite different directions,\n\nand till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselves\n\nto thinking only about things we're certain would be alien truths.\n\nEspecially since this will probably be one of those areas where the\n\nbest guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let's\n\nsee if that one does.)Whatever we call it, the attempt to discover alien truths would be\n\na worthwhile undertaking. And curiously enough, that is itself\n\nprobably an alien truth.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Greg Brockman,\n\nPatrick Collison, Robert Morris, and Michael Nielsen for reading drafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 675, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:30.401932Z"}
{"id": "users", "title": "What I've Learned from Users", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/users.html", "date": null, "content": "September 2022I recently told applicants to Y Combinator that the best advice I\n\ncould give for getting in, per word, was\n\nExplain what you've learned from users.\n\nThat tests a lot of things: whether you're paying attention to\n\nusers, how well you understand them, and even how much they need\n\nwhat you're making.Afterward I asked myself the same question. What have I learned\n\nfrom YC's users, the startups we've funded?The first thing that came to mind was that most startups have the\n\nsame problems. No two have exactly the same problems, but it's\n\nsurprising how much the problems remain the same, regardless of\n\nwhat they're making. Once you've advised 100 startups all doing\n\ndifferent things, you rarely encounter problems you haven't seen\n\nbefore.This fact is one of the things that makes YC work. But I didn't\n\nknow it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our own\n\nstartup, and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me how\n\noften the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stage\n\ninvestors might never realize this, because later stage investors\n\nmight not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partner\n\nwill get this much experience in the first year or two.That's one advantage of funding large numbers of early stage companies\n\nrather than smaller numbers of later-stage ones. You get a lot of\n\ndata. Not just because you're looking at more companies, but also\n\nbecause more goes wrong.But knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn't\n\nmean that advising them can be automated, or reduced to a formula.\n\nThere's no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner.\n\nEach startup is unique, which means they have to be advised\n\nby specific partners who know them well.\n\n[1]We learned that the hard way, in the notorious \"batch that broke\n\nYC\" in the summer of 2012. Up till that point we treated the partners\n\nas a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next\n\navailable slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had\n\nto know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when\n\nthe batch grew to 80, everything broke. The founders probably didn't\n\nrealize anything was wrong, but the partners were confused and\n\nunhappy because halfway through the batch they still didn't know\n\nall the companies yet.\n\n[2]At first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups and\n\nbroken at 80? It was only a third more. Then I realized what had\n\nhappened. We were using an O(n2) algorithm. So of course it blew\n\nup.The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations.\n\nWe sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen\n\nby a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and has\n\nworked fine ever since. But the batch that broke YC was a powerful\n\ndemonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups\n\nhas to be.Another related surprise is how bad founders can be at realizing\n\nwhat their problems are. Founders will sometimes come in to talk\n\nabout some problem, and we'll discover another much bigger one in\n\nthe course of the conversation. For example (and this case is all\n\ntoo common), founders will come in to talk about the difficulties\n\nthey're having raising money, and after digging into their situation,\n\nit turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, and\n\ninvestors can tell. Or founders will come in worried that they still\n\nhaven't cracked the problem of user acquisition, and the reason turns out\n\nto be that their product isn't good enough. There have been times\n\nwhen I've asked \"Would you use this yourself, if you hadn't built\n\nit?\" and the founders, on thinking about it, said \"No.\" Well, there's\n\nthe reason you're having trouble getting users.Often founders know what their problems are, but not their relative\n\nimportance.\n\n[3]\n\nThey'll come in to talk about three problems\n\nthey're worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn't\n\nmatter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn't addressed\n\nimmediately. It's like watching one of those horror movies where\n\nthe heroine is deeply upset that her boyfriend cheated on her, and\n\nonly mildly curious about the door that's mysteriously ajar. You\n\nwant to say: never mind about your boyfriend, think about that door!\n\nFortunately in office hours you can. So while startups still die\n\nwith some regularity, it's rarely because they wandered into a room\n\ncontaining a murderer. The YC partners can warn them where the\n\nmurderers are.Not that founders listen. That was another big surprise: how often\n\nfounders don't listen to us. A couple weeks ago I talked to a partner\n\nwho had been working for YC for a couple batches and was starting\n\nto see the pattern. \"They come back a year later,\" she said, \"and\n\nsay 'We wish we'd listened to you.'\"It took me a long time to figure out why founders don't listen. At\n\nfirst I thought it was mere stubbornness. That's part of the reason,\n\nbut another and probably more important reason is that so much about\n\nstartups is counterintuitive.\n\nAnd when you tell someone something\n\ncounterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason\n\nfounders don't listen to us is that they don't believe us. At\n\nleast not till experience teaches them otherwise.\n\n[4]The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they're so\n\ndifferent from most people's other experiences. No one knows what\n\nit's like except those who've done it. Which is why YC partners\n\nshould usually have been founders themselves. But strangely enough,\n\nthe counterintuitiveness of startups turns out to be another of the\n\nthings that make YC work. If it weren't counterintuitive, founders\n\nwouldn't need our advice about how to do it.Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not\n\nonly do they have a hundred different problems, they don't have\n\nanyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus\n\non things that don't matter, there's no one focusing on the things\n\nthat do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out which\n\nproblems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideally\n\nat a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and\n\nmeasure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable,\n\nnear-term results.This doesn't imply that founders should rush forward regardless of\n\nthe consequences. If you correct course at a high enough frequency,\n\nyou can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentative\n\nat a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed\n\nvery rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And in\n\npractice there's less backtracking than you might expect. Founders\n\nusually guess right about which direction to run in, especially if\n\nthey have someone experienced like a YC partner to bounce their\n\nhypotheses off. And when they guess wrong, they notice fast, because\n\nthey'll talk about the results at office hours the next week.\n\n[5]A small improvement in navigational ability can make you a lot\n\nfaster, because it has a double effect: the path is shorter, and\n\nyou can travel faster along it when you're more certain it's the\n\nright one. That's where a lot of YC's value lies, in helping founders\n\nget an extra increment of focus that lets them move faster. And\n\nsince moving fast is the essence of a startup, YC in effect makes\n\nstartups more startup-like.Speed defines startups. Focus enables speed. YC improves focus.Why are founders uncertain about what to do? Partly because startups\n\nalmost by definition are doing something new, which means no one\n\nknows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what \"it\" is. Partly\n\nbecause startups are so counterintuitive generally. And partly\n\nbecause many founders, especially young and ambitious ones, have\n\nbeen trained to win the wrong way. That took me years to figure\n\nout. The educational system in most countries trains you to win by\n\nhacking the test\n\ninstead of actually doing whatever it's supposed\n\nto measure. But that stops working when you start a startup. So\n\npart of what YC does is to retrain founders to stop trying to hack\n\nthe test. (It takes a surprisingly long time. A year in, you still\n\nsee them reverting to their old habits.)YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge.\n\nIt's more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge\n\nof the YC partners and the founders have different shapes: It\n\nwouldn't be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic\n\nknowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it\n\nwouldn't be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth of\n\ndomain knowledge that a founder has. That's why it can still be\n\nvaluable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still\n\nbe valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach.The other big thing YC gives founders is colleagues, and this may\n\nbe even more important than the advice of partners. If you look at\n\nhistory, great work clusters around certain places and institutions:\n\nFlorence in the late 15th century, the University of Göttingen in\n\nthe late 19th, The New Yorker under Ross, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC.\n\nHowever good you are, good colleagues make you better. Indeed, very\n\nambitious people probably need colleagues more than anyone else,\n\nbecause they're so starved for them in everyday life.Whether or not YC manages one day to be listed alongside those\n\nfamous clusters, it won't be for lack of trying. We were very aware\n\nof this historical phenomenon and deliberately designed YC to be\n\none. By this point it's not bragging to say that it's the biggest\n\ncluster of great startup founders. Even people trying to attack YC\n\nconcede that.Colleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forces\n\nin the world, so you'd expect it to have a big effect to combine\n\nthem. Before YC, to the extent people thought about the question\n\nat all, most assumed they couldn't be combined — that loneliness\n\nwas the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when we\n\nstarted our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handful\n\nof older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), but\n\nno peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about the\n\nmisbehavior of investors, or speculate with about the future of\n\ntechnology. I often tell founders to make something they themselves\n\nwant, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what\n\nwe wanted when we were starting a startup.One thing we wanted was to be able to get seed funding without\n\nhaving to make the rounds of random rich people. That has become a\n\ncommodity now, at least in the US. But great colleagues can never\n\nbecome a commodity, because the fact that they cluster in some\n\nplaces means they're proportionally absent from the rest.Something magical happens where they do cluster though. The energy\n\nin the room at a YC dinner is like nothing else I've experienced.\n\nWe would have been happy just to have one or two other startups to\n\ntalk to. When you have a whole roomful it's another thing entirely.YC founders aren't just inspired by one another. They also help one\n\nanother. That's the happiest thing I've learned about startup\n\nfounders: how generous they can be in helping one another. We noticed\n\nthis in the first batch and consciously designed YC to magnify it.\n\nThe result is something far more intense than, say, a university.\n\nBetween the partners, the alumni, and their batchmates, founders\n\nare surrounded by people who want to help them, and can.Notes[1]\n\nThis is why I've never liked it when people refer to YC as a\n\n\"bootcamp.\" It's intense like a bootcamp, but the opposite in\n\nstructure. Instead of everyone doing the same thing, they're each\n\ntalking to YC partners to figure out what their specific startup\n\nneeds.[2]\n\nWhen I say the summer 2012 batch was broken, I mean it felt\n\nto the partners that something was wrong. Things weren't yet so\n\nbroken that the startups had a worse experience. In fact that batch\n\ndid unusually well.[3]\n\nThis situation reminds me of the research showing that people\n\nare much better at answering questions than they are at judging how\n\naccurate their answers are. The two phenomena feel very similar.[4]\n\nThe Airbnbs were\n\nparticularly good at listening — partly\n\nbecause they were flexible and disciplined, but also because they'd\n\nhad such a rough time during the preceding year. They were ready\n\nto listen.[5]\n\nThe optimal unit of decisiveness depends on how long it takes\n\nto get results, and that depends on the type of problem you're\n\nsolving. When you're negotiating with investors, it could be a\n\ncouple days, whereas if you're building hardware it could be months.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 2145, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:30.995722Z"}
{"id": "heresy", "title": "Heresy", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/heresy.html", "date": null, "content": "April 2022One of the most surprising things I've witnessed in my lifetime is\n\nthe rebirth of the concept of heresy.In his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about the\n\nmoment when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College:\n\nSupported comfortably, Newton was free to devote himself wholly\n\nto whatever he chose. To remain on, he had only to avoid the three\n\nunforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage.\n\n[1]\n\nThe first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly\n\nmedieval. How strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But when\n\nI reread it 20 years later it sounded like a description of\n\ncontemporary employment.There are an ever-increasing number of opinions you can be fired\n\nfor. Those doing the firing don't use the word \"heresy\" to describe\n\nthem, but structurally they're equivalent. Structurally there are\n\ntwo distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priority\n\nover the question of truth or falsity, and (2) that it outweighs\n\neverything else the speaker has done.For example, when someone calls a statement \"x-ist,\" they're also\n\nimplicitly saying that this is the end of the discussion. They do\n\nnot, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement is\n\ntrue or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of\n\nsignalling an exception. That's one of the reasons they're used:\n\nto end a discussion.If you find yourself talking to someone who uses these labels a\n\nlot, it might be worthwhile to ask them explicitly if they believe\n\nany babies are being thrown out with the bathwater. Can a statement\n\nbe x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is\n\nyes, then they're admitting to banning the truth. That's obvious\n\nenough that I'd guess most would answer no. But if they answer no,\n\nit's easy to show that they're mistaken, and that in practice such\n\nlabels are applied to statements regardless of their truth or\n\nfalsity.The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is\n\nconsidered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn't work\n\nthat way. The same statement can't be true when one person says it,\n\nbut x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does.\n\n[2]The other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinary\n\nopinions, is that the public expression of them outweighs everything\n\nelse the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like knowledge of\n\nhistory, or taste in music, you're judged by the average of your\n\nopinions. A heresy is qualitatively different. It's like dropping\n\na chunk of uranium onto the scale.Back in the day (and still, in some places) the punishment for\n\nheresy was death. You could have led a life of exemplary goodness,\n\nbut if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were\n\ngoing to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get\n\nfired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the\n\nstructure of the situation is the same: the heresy\n\noutweighs everything else. You could have spent the last ten years\n\nsaving children's lives, but if you express certain opinions, you're\n\nautomatically fired.It's much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter how\n\nvirtuously you've lived, if you commit a crime, you must still\n\nsuffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless\n\nlife might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn't affect whether\n\nyou're guilty or not.A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime —\n\none that makes some people feel not merely that you're mistaken,\n\nbut that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you\n\npunished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an\n\nactual crime. There are many on the far left who believe\n\nstrongly in the reintegration of felons (as I do myself), and yet\n\nseem to feel that anyone guilty of certain heresies should never\n\nwork again.There are always some heresies — some opinions you'd be punished\n\nfor expressing. But there are a lot more now than there were a few\n\ndecades ago, and even those who are happy about this would have to\n\nagree that it's so.Why? Why has this antiquated-sounding religious concept come back\n\nin a secular form? And why now?You need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerant\n\npeople, and an ideology to guide them. The intolerant people are\n\nalways there. They exist in every sufficiently large society. That's\n\nwhy waves of intolerance can arise so suddenly; all they need is\n\nsomething to set them off.I've already written an essay\n\ndescribing the aggressively\n\nconventional-minded. The short version is that people can be\n\nclassified in two dimensions according to (1) how independent- or\n\nconventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are about\n\nit. The aggressively conventional-minded are the enforcers of\n\northodoxy.Normally they're only locally visible. They're the grumpy, censorious\n\npeople in a group — the ones who are always first to complain when\n\nsomething violates the current rules of propriety. But occasionally,\n\nlike a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large number\n\nof aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideology\n\nall at once. Then they become much more of a problem, because a mob\n\ndynamic takes over, where the enthusiasm of each participant is\n\nincreased by the enthusiasm of the others.The most notorious 20th century case may have been the Cultural\n\nRevolution. Though initiated by Mao to undermine his rivals, the\n\nCultural Revolution was otherwise mostly a grass-roots phenomenon.\n\nMao said in essence: There are heretics among us. Seek them out and\n\npunish them. And that's all the aggressively conventional-minded\n\never need to hear. They went at it with the delight of dogs chasing\n\nsquirrels.To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the\n\nfeatures of a religion. In particular it must have strict and\n\narbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their\n\npurity\n\nby obeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these\n\nrules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn't.\n\n[3]In the late 1980s a new ideology of this type appeared in US\n\nuniversities. It had a very strong component of moral purity, and\n\nthe aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usual\n\neagerness — all the more because the relaxation of social norms\n\nin the preceding decades meant there had been less and less to\n\nforbid. The resulting wave of intolerance has been eerily similar\n\nin form to the Cultural Revolution, though fortunately much smaller\n\nin magnitude.\n\n[4]I've deliberately avoided mentioning any specific heresies here.\n\nPartly because one of the universal tactics of heretic hunters, now\n\nas in the past, is to accuse those who disapprove of the way in\n\nwhich they suppress ideas of being heretics themselves. Indeed,\n\nthis tactic is so consistent that you could use it as a way of\n\ndetecting witch hunts in any era.And that's the second reason I've avoided mentioning any specific\n\nheresies. I want this essay to work in the future, not just now.\n\nAnd unfortunately it probably will. The aggressively conventional-minded\n\nwill always be among us, looking for things to forbid. All they\n\nneed is an ideology to tell them what. And it's unlikely the current\n\none will be the last.There are aggressively conventional-minded people on both the right\n\nand the left. The reason the current wave of intolerance comes from\n\nthe left is simply because the new unifying ideology happened to\n\ncome from the left. The next one might come from the right. Imagine\n\nwhat that would be like.Fortunately in western countries the suppression of heresies is\n\nnothing like as bad as it used to be. Though the window of opinions\n\nyou can express publicly has narrowed in the last decade, it's still\n\nmuch wider than it was a few hundred years ago. The problem is the\n\nderivative. Up till about 1985 the window had been growing ever\n\nwider. Anyone looking into the future in 1985 would have expected\n\nfreedom of expression to continue to increase. Instead it has\n\ndecreased.\n\n[5]The situation is similar to what's happened with infectious diseases\n\nlike measles. Anyone looking into the future in 2010 would have\n\nexpected the number of measles cases in the US to continue to\n\ndecrease. Instead, thanks to anti-vaxxers, it has increased. The\n\nabsolute number is still not that high. The problem is the derivative.\n\n[6]In both cases it's hard to know how much to worry. Is it really\n\ndangerous to society as a whole if a handful of extremists refuse\n\nto get their kids vaccinated, or shout down speakers at universities?\n\nThe point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts start\n\nto spill over into everyone else's lives. And in both cases that\n\ndoes seem to be happening.So it's probably worth spending some amount of effort on pushing\n\nback to keep open the window of free expression. My hope is that\n\nthis essay will help form social antibodies not just against current\n\nefforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy in\n\ngeneral. That's the real prize. How do you disable the concept of\n\nheresy? Since the Enlightenment, western societies have discovered\n\nmany techniques for doing that, but there are surely more to be\n\ndiscovered.Overall I'm optimistic. Though the trend in freedom of expression\n\nhas been bad over the last decade, it's been good over the longer\n\nterm. And there are signs that the current wave of intolerance is\n\npeaking. Independent-minded people I talk to seem more confident\n\nthan they did a few years ago. On the other side, even some of the\n\nleaders are starting to wonder if things have\n\ngone too far. And popular culture among the young has already moved on.\n\nAll we have\n\nto do is keep pushing back, and the wave collapses. And then we'll\n\nbe net ahead, because as well as having defeated this wave, we'll\n\nalso have developed new tactics for resisting the next one.Notes[1]\n\nOr more accurately, biographies of Newton, since Westfall wrote\n\ntwo: a long version called Never at Rest, and a shorter one called\n\nThe Life of Isaac Newton. Both are great. The short version moves\n\nfaster, but the long one is full of interesting and often very funny\n\ndetails. This passage is the same in both.[2]\n\nAnother more subtle but equally damning bit of evidence is\n\nthat claims of x-ism are never qualified. You never hear anyone say\n\nthat a statement is \"probably x-ist\" or \"almost certainly y-ist.\"\n\nIf claims of x-ism were actually claims about truth, you'd expect\n\nto see \"probably\" in front of \"x-ist\" as often as you see it in\n\nfront of \"fallacious.\"[3]\n\nThe rules must be strict, but they need not be demanding. So\n\nthe most effective type of rules are those about superficial matters,\n\nlike doctrinal minutiae, or the precise words adherents must use.\n\nSuch rules can be made extremely complicated, and yet don't repel\n\npotential converts by requiring significant sacrifice.The superficial demands of orthodoxy make it an inexpensive substitute\n\nfor virtue. And that in turn is one of the reasons orthodoxy is so\n\nattractive to bad people. You could be a horrible person, and yet\n\nas long as you're orthodox, you're better than everyone who isn't.[4]\n\nArguably there were two. The first had died down somewhat by\n\n2000, but was followed by a second in the 2010s, probably caused\n\nby social media.[5]\n\nFortunately most of those trying to suppress ideas today still\n\nrespect Enlightenment principles enough to pay lip service to them.\n\nThey know they're not supposed to ban ideas per se, so they have\n\nto recast the ideas as causing \"harm,\" which sounds like something\n\nthat can be banned. The more extreme try to claim speech itself is\n\nviolence, or even that silence is. But strange as it may sound,\n\nsuch gymnastics are a good sign. We'll know we're really in trouble\n\nwhen they stop bothering to invent pretenses for banning ideas —\n\nwhen, like the medieval church, they say \"Damn right we're banning\n\nideas, and in fact here's a list of them.\"[6]\n\nPeople only have the luxury of ignoring the medical consensus\n\nabout vaccines because vaccines have worked so well. If we didn't\n\nhave any vaccines at all, the mortality rate would be so high that\n\nmost current anti-vaxxers would be begging for them. And the situation\n\nwith freedom of expression is similar. It's only because they live\n\nin a world created by the Enlightenment that kids from the suburbs\n\ncan play at banning ideas.Thanks to Marc Andreessen, Chris Best,\n\nTrevor Blackwell, Nicholas\n\nChristakis, Daniel Gackle, Jonathan Haidt, Claire Lehmann, Jessica\n\nLivingston, Greg Lukianoff, Robert Morris, and Garry Tan for reading\n\ndrafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 2077, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:31.628441Z"}
{"id": "words", "title": "Putting Ideas into Words", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/words.html", "date": null, "content": "February 2022Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows\n\nyou that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas\n\ninto words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually\n\nwrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over  to\n\nget them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but\n\nincomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones\n\nyou thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write\n\nthem.Once you publish something, the convention is that whatever you\n\nwrote was what you thought before you wrote it. These were your\n\nideas, and now you've expressed them. But you know this isn't true.\n\nYou know that putting your ideas into words changed them. And not\n\njust the ideas you published. Presumably there were others that\n\nturned out to be too broken to fix, and those you discarded instead.It's not just having to commit your ideas to specific words that\n\nmakes writing so exacting. The real test is reading what you've\n\nwritten. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing\n\nof what's in your head, only what you wrote. When he reads what you\n\nwrote, does it seem correct? Does it seem complete? If you make an\n\neffort, you can read your writing as if you were a complete stranger,\n\nand when you do the news is usually bad. It takes me many cycles\n\nbefore I can get an essay past the stranger. But the stranger is\n\nrational, so you always can, if you ask him what he needs. If he's\n\nnot satisfied because you failed to mention x or didn't qualify\n\nsome sentence sufficiently, then you mention x or add more\n\nqualifications. Happy now? It may cost you some nice sentences, but\n\nyou have to resign yourself to that. You just have to make them as\n\ngood as you can and still satisfy the stranger.This much, I assume, won't be that controversial. I think it will\n\naccord with the experience of anyone who has tried to write about\n\nanything nontrivial. There may exist people whose thoughts are so\n\nperfectly formed that they just flow straight into words. But I've\n\nnever known anyone who could do this, and if I met someone who said\n\nthey could, it would seem evidence of their limitations rather than\n\ntheir ability. Indeed, this is a trope in movies: the guy who claims\n\nto have a plan for doing some difficult thing, and who when questioned\n\nfurther, taps his head and says \"It's all up here.\" Everyone watching\n\nthe movie knows what that means. At best the plan is vague and\n\nincomplete. Very likely there's some undiscovered flaw that invalidates\n\nit completely. At best it's a plan for a plan.In precisely defined domains it's possible to form complete ideas\n\nin your head. People can play chess in their heads, for example.\n\nAnd mathematicians can do some amount of math in their heads, though\n\nthey don't seem to feel sure of a proof over a certain length till\n\nthey write it down. But this only seems possible with ideas you can\n\nexpress in a formal language.  [1] Arguably what such people are\n\ndoing is putting ideas into words in their heads. I can to some\n\nextent write essays in my head. I'll sometimes think of a paragraph\n\nwhile walking or lying in bed that survives nearly unchanged in the\n\nfinal version. But really I'm writing when I do this. I'm doing the\n\nmental part of writing; my fingers just aren't moving as I do it.\n\n[2]You can know a great deal about something without writing about it.\n\nCan you ever know so much that you wouldn't learn more from trying\n\nto explain what you know? I don't think so. I've written about at\n\nleast two subjects I know well — Lisp hacking and startups\n\n— and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about them.\n\nIn both cases there were things I didn't consciously realize till\n\nI had to explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous.\n\nA great deal of knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if\n\nanything a higher proportion of unconscious knowledge than beginners.I'm not saying that writing is the best way to explore all ideas.\n\nIf you have ideas about architecture, presumably the best way to\n\nexplore them is to build actual buildings. What I'm saying is that\n\nhowever much you learn from exploring ideas in other ways, you'll\n\nstill learn new things from writing about them.Putting ideas into words doesn't have to mean writing, of course.\n\nYou can also do it the old way, by talking. But in my experience,\n\nwriting is the stricter test. You have to commit to a single, optimal\n\nsequence of words. Less can go unsaid when you don't have tone of\n\nvoice to carry meaning. And you can focus in a way that would seem\n\nexcessive in conversation. I'll often spend 2 weeks on an essay and\n\nreread drafts 50 times. If you did that in conversation\n\nit would seem evidence of some kind of\n\nmental disorder.\n\nIf you're lazy,\n\nof course, writing and talking are equally useless. But if you want\n\nto push yourself to get things right, writing is the steeper hill.\n\n[3]The reason I've spent so long establishing this rather obvious point\n\nis that it leads to another that many people will find shocking.\n\nIf writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more\n\ncomplete, then no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully\n\nformed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully\n\nformed ideas about anything nontrivial.It feels to them as if they do, especially if they're not in the\n\nhabit of critically examining their own thinking. Ideas can feel\n\ncomplete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you\n\ndiscover they're not. So if you never subject your ideas to that\n\ntest, you'll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never\n\nrealize it.Putting ideas into words is certainly no guarantee that they'll be\n\nright. Far from it. But though it's not a sufficient condition, it\n\nis a necessary one.Notes[1] Machinery and\n\ncircuits are formal languages.[2] I thought of this\n\nsentence as I was walking down the street in Palo Alto.[3] There are two\n\nsenses of talking to someone: a strict sense in which the conversation\n\nis verbal, and a more general sense in which it can take any form,\n\nincluding writing. In the limit case (e.g. Seneca's letters),\n\nconversation in the latter sense becomes essay writing.It can be very useful to talk (in either sense) with other people\n\nas you're writing something. But a verbal conversation will never\n\nbe more exacting than when you're talking about something you're\n\nwriting.

{"id": "goodtaste", "title": "Is There Such a Thing as Good Taste?", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/goodtaste.html", "date": "2021-11", "content": "November 2021(This essay is derived from a talk at the Cambridge Union.)When I was a kid, I'd have said there wasn't. My father told me so.\n\nSome people like some things, and other people like other things,\n\nand who's to say who's right?It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste\n\nthat it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father\n\nwas wrong. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by\n\nreductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there's no\n\nsuch thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are\n\nobviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.We'd better start by saying what good taste is. There's a narrow\n\nsense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one\n\nin which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proof\n\nwould be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm\n\ngoing to talk about taste in art. You have better taste than me if\n\nthe art you like is better than the art I like.If there's no such thing as good taste, then there's no such thing\n\nas good art. Because if there is such a\n\nthing as good art, it's\n\neasy to tell which of two people has better taste. Show them a lot\n\nof works by artists they've never seen before and ask them to\n\nchoose the best, and whoever chooses the better art has better\n\ntaste.So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have\n\nto discard the concept of good art. And that means you have to\n\ndiscard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which\n\nmeans there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not\n\njust visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You\n\ncan't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers\n\neither. You can have popular novelists, but not good ones.We don't realize how far we'd have to go if we discarded the concept\n\nof good taste, because we don't even debate the most obvious cases.\n\nBut it doesn't just mean we can't say which of two famous painters\n\nis better. It means we can't say that any painter is better than a\n\nrandomly chosen eight year old.That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying\n\npainting. And it was just like other kinds of work I'd done: you\n\ncould do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get\n\nbetter at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were\n\nmuch better at it than me. That gap between us was not imaginary.\n\nThey were so good. And if they could be good, then art could be\n\ngood, and there was such a thing as good taste after all.Now that I've explained how to show there is such a thing as good\n\ntaste, I should also explain why people think there isn't. There\n\nare two reasons. One is that there's always so much disagreement\n\nabout taste. Most people's response to art is a tangle of unexamined\n\nimpulses. Is the artist famous? Is the subject attractive? Is this\n\nthe sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous\n\nmuseum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book? In practice most\n\npeople's response to art is dominated by such extraneous factors.And the people who do claim to have good taste are so often mistaken.\n\nThe paintings admired by the so-called experts in one generation\n\nare often so different from those admired a few generations later.\n\nIt's easy to conclude there's nothing real there at all. It's only\n\nwhen you isolate this force, for example by trying to paint and\n\ncomparing your work to Bellini's, that you can see that it does in\n\nfact exist.The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there\n\ndoesn't seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. The\n\nargument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a work\n\nof art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a\n\nproperty of objects, it should be in the object somehow. But it\n\ndoesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads\n\nof each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose\n\nbetween them?The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art\n\nis to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common.\n\nAnd to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the\n\nsame way, that's arguably what it means for the object to have the\n\ncorresponding property. If everything a particle interacts with\n\nbehaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a mass of\n\nm. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not\n\nbinary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects\n\nhave in common. Particles interacting with one another are at one\n\npole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the\n\nother; their reactions aren't random.Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed\n\nto operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively\n\nit does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If someone were talking about\n\nthe ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very\n\nfrivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property\n\nof vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens\n\nin the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people's\n\nimmune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not\n\nwork on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about\n\nthe effectiveness of a vaccine.The situation with art is messier, of course. You can't measure\n\neffectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines.\n\nYou have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledge\n\nof art, and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous\n\ninfluences like the fame of the artist. And even then you'd still\n\nsee some disagreement. People do vary, and judging art is hard,\n\nespecially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either\n\nof works or of people's ability to judge them. But there is equally\n\ndefinitely a partial order of both. So while it's not possible to\n\nhave perfect taste, it is possible to have good taste.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1087, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:32.827110Z"}
{"id": "smart", "title": "Beyond Smart", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/smart.html", "date": null, "content": "October 2021If you asked people what was special about Einstein, most would say\n\nthat he was really smart. Even the ones who tried to give you a\n\nmore sophisticated-sounding answer would probably think this first.\n\nTill a few years ago I would have given the same answer myself. But\n\nthat wasn't what was special about Einstein. What was special about\n\nhim was that he had important new ideas. Being very smart was a\n\nnecessary precondition for having those ideas, but the two are not\n\nidentical.It may seem a hair-splitting distinction to point out that intelligence\n\nand its consequences are not identical, but it isn't. There's a big\n\ngap between them. Anyone who's spent time around universities and\n\nresearch labs knows how big. There are a lot of genuinely smart\n\npeople who don't achieve very much.I grew up thinking that being smart was the thing most to be desired.\n\nPerhaps you did too. But I bet it's not what you really want. Imagine\n\nyou had a choice between being really smart but discovering nothing\n\nnew, and being less smart but discovering lots of new ideas. Surely\n\nyou'd take the latter. I would. The choice makes me uncomfortable,\n\nbut when you see the two options laid out explicitly like that,\n\nit's obvious which is better.The reason the choice makes me uncomfortable is that being smart\n\nstill feels like the thing that matters, even though I know\n\nintellectually that it isn't. I spent so many years thinking it\n\nwas. The circumstances of childhood are a perfect storm for fostering\n\nthis illusion. Intelligence is much easier to measure than the value\n\nof new ideas, and you're constantly being judged by it. Whereas\n\neven the kids who will ultimately discover new things aren't usually\n\ndiscovering them yet. For kids that way inclined, intelligence is\n\nthe only game in town.There are more subtle reasons too, which persist long into adulthood.\n\nIntelligence wins in conversation, and thus becomes the basis of\n\nthe dominance hierarchy.\n\n[1]\n\nPlus having new ideas is such a new\n\nthing historically, and even now done by so few people, that society\n\nhasn't yet assimilated the fact that this is the actual destination,\n\nand intelligence merely a means to an end.\n\n[2]Why do so many smart people fail to discover anything new? Viewed\n\nfrom that direction, the question seems a rather depressing one.\n\nBut there's another way to look at it that's not just more optimistic,\n\nbut more interesting as well. Clearly intelligence is not the only\n\ningredient in having new ideas. What are the other ingredients?\n\nAre they things we could cultivate?Because the trouble with intelligence, they say, is that it's mostly\n\ninborn. The evidence for this seems fairly convincing, especially\n\nconsidering that most of us don't want it to be true, and the\n\nevidence thus has to face a stiff headwind. But I'm not going\n\nto get into that question here, because it's the other ingredients\n\nin new ideas that I care about, and it's clear that many of them\n\ncan be cultivated.That means the truth is excitingly different from the story I got\n\nas a kid. If intelligence is what matters, and also mostly inborn,\n\nthe natural consequence is a sort of Brave New World fatalism. The\n\nbest you can do is figure out what sort of work you have an \"aptitude\"\n\nfor, so that whatever intelligence you were born with will at least\n\nbe put to the best use, and then work as hard as you can at it.\n\nWhereas if intelligence isn't what matters, but only one of several\n\ningredients in what does, and many of those aren't inborn, things\n\nget more interesting. You have a lot more control, but the problem\n\nof how to arrange your life becomes that much more complicated.So what are the other ingredients in having new ideas? The fact\n\nthat I can even ask this question proves the point I raised earlier\n\n— that society hasn't assimilated the fact that it's this and not\n\nintelligence that matters. Otherwise we'd all know the answers\n\nto such a fundamental question.\n\n[3]I'm not going to try to provide a complete catalogue of the other\n\ningredients here. This is the first time I've posed\n\nthe question to myself this way, and I think it may take a while\n\nto answer. But I wrote recently about one of the most important:\n\nan obsessive interest in a particular topic.\n\nAnd this can definitely be cultivated.Another quality you need in order to discover new ideas is\n\nindependent-mindedness. I wouldn't want to\n\nclaim that this is\n\ndistinct from intelligence — I'd be reluctant to call someone smart\n\nwho wasn't independent-minded — but though largely inborn, this\n\nquality seems to be something that can be cultivated to some extent.There are general techniques for having new ideas — for example,\n\nfor working on your own projects\n\nand\n\nfor overcoming the obstacles you face with early work\n\n— and these\n\ncan all be learned. Some of them can be learned by societies. And\n\nthere are also collections of techniques for generating specific types\n\nof new ideas, like startup ideas and\n\nessay topics.And of course there are a lot of fairly mundane ingredients in\n\ndiscovering new ideas, like working hard,\n\ngetting enough sleep, avoiding certain\n\nkinds of stress, having the right colleagues, and finding tricks\n\nfor working on what you want even when it's not what you're supposed\n\nto be working on. Anything that prevents people from doing great\n\nwork has an inverse that helps them to. And this class of ingredients\n\nis not as boring as it might seem at first. For example, having new\n\nideas is generally associated with youth. But perhaps it's not youth\n\nper se that yields new ideas, but specific things that come with\n\nyouth, like good health and lack of responsibilities. Investigating\n\nthis might lead to strategies that will help people of any age to\n\nhave better ideas.One of the most surprising ingredients in having new ideas is writing\n\nability. There's a class of new ideas that are best discovered by\n\nwriting essays and books. And that \"by\" is deliberate: you don't\n\nthink of the ideas first, and then merely write them down. There\n\nis a kind of thinking that one does by writing, and if you're clumsy\n\nat writing, or don't enjoy doing it, that will get in your way if\n\nyou try to do this kind of thinking.\n\n[4]I predict the gap between intelligence and new ideas will turn out\n\nto be an interesting place. If we think of this gap merely as a measure\n\nof unrealized potential, it becomes a sort of wasteland that we try to\n\nhurry through with our eyes averted. But if we flip the question,\n\nand start inquiring into the other ingredients in new ideas that\n\nit implies must exist, we can mine this gap for discoveries about\n\ndiscovery.\n\nNotes[1]\n\nWhat wins in conversation depends on who with. It ranges from\n\nmere aggressiveness at the bottom, through quick-wittedness in the\n\nmiddle, to something closer to actual intelligence at the top,\n\nthough probably always with some component of quick-wittedness.[2]\n\nJust as intelligence isn't the only ingredient in having new\n\nideas, having new ideas isn't the only thing intelligence is useful\n\nfor. It's also useful, for example, in diagnosing problems and figuring\n\nout how to fix them. Both overlap with having new ideas, but both\n\nhave an end that doesn't.Those ways of using intelligence are much more common than having\n\nnew ideas. And in such cases intelligence is even harder to distinguish\n\nfrom its consequences.[3]\n\nSome would attribute the difference between intelligence and\n\nhaving new ideas to \"creativity,\" but this doesn't seem a very\n\nuseful term. As well as being pretty vague, it's shifted half a frame\n\nsideways from what we care about: it's neither separable from\n\nintelligence, nor responsible for all the difference between\n\nintelligence and having new ideas.[4]\n\nCuriously enough, this essay is an example. It started out\n\nas an essay about writing ability. But when I came to the distinction\n\nbetween intelligence and having new ideas, that seemed so much more\n\nimportant that I turned the original essay inside out, making that\n\nthe topic and my original topic one of the points in it. As in many\n\nother fields, that level of reworking is easier to contemplate once\n\nyou've had a lot of practice.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1382, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:33.495876Z"}
{"id": "weird", "title": "Weird Languages", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/weird.html", "date": null, "content": "August 2021When people say that in their experience all programming languages\n\nare basically equivalent, they're making a statement not about\n\nlanguages but about the kind of programming they've done.99.5% of programming consists of gluing together calls to library\n\nfunctions. All popular languages are equally good at this. So one\n\ncan easily spend one's whole career operating in the intersection\n\nof popular programming languages.But the other .5% of programming is disproportionately interesting.\n\nIf you want to learn what it consists of, the weirdness of weird\n\nlanguages is a good clue to follow.Weird languages aren't weird by accident. Not the good ones, at\n\nleast. The weirdness of the good ones usually implies the existence\n\nof some form of programming that's not just the usual gluing together\n\nof library calls.A concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to\n\nmany Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of\n\npopular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement\n\nproperly in a language without turning it into a dialect of\n\nLisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go\n\nbeyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first\n\nwriting a language for problems of that type, and then writing\n\nyour specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with\n\nmacros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulating\n\ntechniques that even now is far from fully explored.So if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be,\n\none way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language\n\nthat most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart,\n\nand then focus on the differences between this language and the\n\nintersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language\n\nthat would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the\n\nprocess of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say,\n\nyou'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't\n\npreviously think.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 324, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:34.096039Z"}
{"id": "hwh", "title": "How to Work Hard", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html", "date": null, "content": "June 2021It might not seem there's much to learn about how to work hard.\n\nAnyone who's been to school knows what it entails, even if they\n\nchose not to do it. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And\n\nyet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I\n\nwas in school, the answer is definitely yes.One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you'll\n\nhave to work very hard. I wasn't sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork\n\nvaried in difficulty; one didn't always have to work super hard to\n\ndo well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to\n\ndo almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard\n\nwork through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.\n\nThere isn't.The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had low\n\nstandards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do things\n\neffortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy.Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural ability\n\ntoo. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,\n\npractice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but to\n\ndo the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability\n\nand to have practiced a lot and to be trying very hard.\n\n[1]Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in business\n\nin his era, but he was also among the hardest working. \"I never\n\ntook a day off in my twenties,\" he said. \"Not one.\" It was similar\n\nwith Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youth\n\ncoaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent but\n\nhis dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probably\n\nget my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I had\n\nto choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no one\n\never worked harder. At 74, he wrote\n\nwith each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that\n\nthis time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A\n\ngood thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one's toes and\n\nmakes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases\n\ntwenty times.\n\nSounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds even\n\nmore extreme. Not one day off in ten years?  These two had about\n\nas much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they also\n\nworked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both.That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hard\n\nto grasp. There's a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comes\n\npartly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, and\n\npartly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talent\n\nand great drive are both rare, then people with both are rare\n\nsquared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have less\n\nof the other. But you'll need both if you want to be an outlier\n\nyourself. And since you can't really change how much natural talent\n\nyou have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reduces\n\nto working very hard.It's straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,\n\nexternally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some technique\n\nto it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate\n\n(which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, and\n\nnot to give up when things go wrong. But this level of discipline\n\nseems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they want\n\nit.What I've learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goals\n\nthat are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You'll\n\nprobably have to learn both if you want to do really great things.The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be working\n\nwithout anyone telling you to. Now, when I'm not working hard, alarm\n\nbells go off. I can't be sure I'm getting anywhere when I'm working\n\nhard, but I can be sure I'm getting nowhere when I'm not, and it\n\nfeels awful.\n\n[2]There wasn't a single point when I learned this. Like most little\n\nkids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or did\n\nsomething new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling of\n\ndisgust when I wasn't achieving anything. The one precisely dateable\n\nlandmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age 13.Several people I've talked to remember getting serious about work\n\naround this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started to\n\nfind idleness distasteful, he said\n\nI think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around\n\nthen of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering\n\nwhy I was wasting my summer holiday.\n\nPerhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense.Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious about\n\nwork was probably school, which made work (what they called work)\n\nseem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was before\n\nI could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, because\n\neven in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entire\n\ndepartments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of real\n\nwork, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they'd\n\nbeen made for each other.I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can\n\nlove it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in A Mathematician's\n\nApology:\n\nI do not remember having felt, as a boy, any passion for\n\nmathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of\n\na mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in\n\nterms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other\n\nboys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most\n\ndecisively.\n\nHe didn't learn what math was really about till part way through\n\ncollege, when he read Jordan's Cours d'analyse.\n\nI shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that\n\nremarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians\n\nof my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what\n\nmathematics really meant.\n\nThere are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn to\n\ndiscount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kind\n\nHardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they're\n\nadapted to be taught to kids — often so distorted that they're\n\nnothing like the work done by actual practitioners.\n\n[3]\n\nThe other\n\nkind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some types\n\nof work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork.There's a kind of solidity to real work. It's not all writing the\n\nPrincipia, but it all feels necessary. That's a vague criterion,\n\nbut it's deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot of\n\ndifferent types.\n\n[4]Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how many\n\nhours a day to spend on it. You can't solve this problem by simply\n\nworking every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there's a\n\npoint beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.\n\nI've done several different kinds of work, and the limits were\n\ndifferent for each. My limit for the harder types of writing or\n\nprogramming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was running\n\na startup, I could\n\nwork all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I'd\n\nkept going much longer, I'd probably have needed to take occasional\n\nvacations.\n\n[5]The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate a\n\nsensitivity to the quality of the work you're doing, and then you'll\n\nnotice if it decreases because you're working too hard. Honesty is\n\ncritical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you're\n\nbeing lazy, but also when you're working too hard. And if you think\n\nthere's something admirable about working too hard, get that idea\n\nout of your head. You're not merely getting worse results, but\n\ngetting them because you're showing off — if not to other people,\n\nthen to yourself.\n\n[6]Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process,\n\nnot something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work and\n\nyour ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to be\n\nconstantly judging both how hard you're trying and how well you're\n\ndoing.Trying hard doesn't mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though.\n\nThere may be some people who do, but I think my experience is fairly\n\ntypical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I'm\n\nstarting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That's\n\nwhen I'm in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, I\n\ntend to keep going.What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was working\n\non Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinated\n\nat all then, because there was always something that needed doing,\n\nand if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beast\n\nby doing it, why wait? [7]\n\nWhereas what drives me now, writing\n\nessays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days,\n\nlike a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. But\n\nonce I get started on one, I don't have to push myself to work,\n\nbecause there's always some error or omission already pushing me.I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Many\n\nproblems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuff\n\nat the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to the\n\nextent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you'll\n\nonly be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you should\n\nalways be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling.The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of these\n\nproblems with a hard core. There are important problems at the\n\ncenter, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones at\n\nthe edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved in\n\nworking on a specific problem, you'll occasionally have to make\n\nbig, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.\n\nAnd the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward the\n\ncenter — toward the most ambitious problems.By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the current\n\nconsensus about the center. The consensus about which problems are\n\nmost important is often mistaken, both in general and within specific\n\nfields. If you disagree with it, and you're right, that could\n\nrepresent a valuable opportunity to do something new.The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but although\n\nyou should not be in denial about this, neither should you treat\n\ndifficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If you\n\ndiscover some ambitious type of work that's a bargain in the sense\n\nof being easier for you than other people, either because of the\n\nabilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you've\n\nfound to approach it, or simply because you're more excited about\n\nit, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done by\n\npeople who find an easy way to do something hard.As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure out\n\nwhich kind you're suited for. And that doesn't just mean figuring\n\nout which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn't\n\nmean that if you're 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. What\n\nyou're suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps even\n\nmore on your interests. A deep interest\n\nin a topic makes people\n\nwork harder than any amount of discipline can.It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents.\n\nThere are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start to\n\nbe judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is a\n\nsubtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later.\n\nThe topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerful\n\nsources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you really\n\ninterested in x, or do you want to work on it because you'll make\n\na lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you,\n\nor because your parents want you to?\n\n[8]The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormously\n\nfrom one person to another. That's one of the most important things\n\nI've learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get the\n\nimpression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do is\n\nfigure out what it is. That's how it works in movies, and in the\n\nstreamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that way\n\nin real life. Some people figure out what to do as children and\n\njust do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlessly\n\nfrom one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identify\n\none as their calling — we can wish Newton spent more time on math\n\nand physics and less on alchemy and theology — but this is an\n\nillusion induced by hindsight bias.\n\nThere was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.So while some people's lives converge fast, there will be others\n\nwhose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out what\n\nto work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoing\n\npart of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For these\n\npeople, the process I described earlier has a third component: along\n\nwith measuring both how hard you're working and how well you're\n\ndoing, you have to think about whether you should keep working in\n\nthis field or switch to another. If you're working hard but not\n\ngetting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simple\n\nexpressed that way, but in practice it's very difficult. You shouldn't\n\ngive up on the first day just because you work hard and don't get\n\nanywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how much\n\ntime? And what should you do if work that was going well stops going\n\nwell? How much time do you give yourself then?\n\n[9]What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide.\n\nIf you're exploring an area few others have worked in, you may not\n\neven know what good results look like. History is full of examples\n\nof people who misjudged the importance of what they were working\n\non.The best test of whether it's worthwhile to work on something is\n\nwhether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerously\n\nsubjective measure, but it's probably the most accurate one you're\n\ngoing to get. You're the one working on the stuff. Who's in a better\n\nposition than you to judge whether it's important, and what's a\n\nbetter predictor of its importance than whether it's interesting?For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself.\n\nIndeed, that's the most striking thing about the whole question of\n\nworking hard: how at each point it depends on being honest with\n\nyourself.Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It's a complicated,\n\ndynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. You\n\nhave to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kind\n\nyou're best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as you\n\ncan, accurately judge at each moment both what you're capable of\n\nand how you're doing, and put in as many hours each day as you can\n\nwithout harming the quality of the result. This network is too\n\ncomplicated to trick. But if you're consistently honest and\n\nclear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, and\n\nyou'll be productive in a way few people are.Notes[1]\n\nIn \"The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius\" I said the three ingredients\n\nin great work were natural ability, determination, and interest.\n\nThat's the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interest\n\nyield practice and effort.[2]\n\nI mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You'll often\n\nget somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution to\n\na problem comes to you while taking a\n\nshower, or even in your sleep,\n\nbut only because you were working hard on it the day before.It's good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation,\n\nI like to learn new things. I wouldn't like just sitting on a beach.[3]\n\nThe thing kids do in school that's most like the real version\n\nis sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games played\n\nin schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactly\n\nwhat adults do.In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretending\n\nto do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend.\n\nArguably the latter is no worse.[4]\n\nKnowing what you want to work on doesn't mean you'll be able\n\nto. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on things\n\nthey don't want to, especially early on. But if you know what you\n\nwant to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in.[5]\n\nThe lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution to\n\nthe problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switch\n\nto harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately.[6]\n\nSome cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. I\n\ndon't love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of something\n\nimportant and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doing\n\nthings that don't matter. I don't know enough to say for sure whether\n\nit's net good or bad, but my guess is bad.[7]\n\nOne of the reasons people work so hard on startups is that\n\nstartups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be both\n\ndecisive and conspicuous.[8]\n\nIt's ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You need\n\nto solve the money problem somehow, and there's nothing wrong with\n\ndoing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I suppose\n\nit would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake;\n\nwhatever floats your boat. Just so long as you're conscious of your\n\nmotivations. The thing to avoid is unconsciously letting the need\n\nfor money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find most\n\ninteresting.[9]\n\nMany people face this question on a smaller scale with\n\nindividual projects. But it's easier both to recognize and to accept\n\na dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of work\n\nentirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like a\n\nSpanish Flu victim, you're fighting your own immune system: Instead\n\nof giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And who\n\ncan say you're not right?", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 3247, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:34.682676Z"}
{"id": "own", "title": "A Project of One's Own", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/own.html", "date": null, "content": "June 2021A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old son\n\ntold me he couldn't wait to get home to write more of the story he\n\nwas working on. This made me as happy as anything I've heard him\n\nsay — not just because he was excited about his story, but because\n\nhe'd discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your\n\nown is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking.\n\nIt's more fun, but also much more productive.What proportion of great work has been done by people who were\n\nskating in this sense? If not all of it, certainly a lot.There is something special about working on a project of your own.\n\nI wouldn't say exactly that you're happier. A better word would be\n\nexcited, or engaged. You're happy when things are going well, but\n\noften they aren't. When I'm writing an essay, most of the time I'm\n\nworried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly,\n\nand puzzled because I'm groping for some idea that I can't see\n\nclearly enough. Will I be able to pin it down with words? In the\n\nend I usually can, if I take long enough, but I'm never sure; the\n\nfirst few attempts often fail.You have moments of happiness when things work out, but they don't\n\nlast long, because then you're on to the next problem. So why do\n\nit at all? Because to the kind of people who like working this way,\n\nnothing else feels as right. You feel as if you're an animal in its\n\nnatural habitat, doing what you were meant to do — not always\n\nhappy, maybe, but awake and alive.Many kids experience the excitement of working on projects of their\n\nown. The hard part is making this converge with the work you do as\n\nan adult. And our customs make it harder. We treat \"playing\" and\n\n\"hobbies\" as qualitatively different from \"work\". It's not clear\n\nto a kid building a treehouse that there's a direct (though long)\n\nroute from that to architecture or engineering. And instead of\n\npointing out the route, we conceal it, by implicitly treating the\n\nstuff kids do as different from real work.\n\n[1]Instead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the path\n\nto the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes through\n\nschool. And unfortunately schoolwork tends to be very different from\n\nworking on projects of one's own. It's usually neither a project,\n\nnor one's own. So as school gets more serious, working on projects\n\nof one's own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread\n\noff to the side.It's a bit sad to think of all the high school kids turning their\n\nbacks on building treehouses and sitting in class dutifully learning\n\nabout Darwin or Newton to pass some exam, when the work that made\n\nDarwin and Newton famous was actually closer in spirit to building\n\ntreehouses than studying for exams.If I had to choose between my kids getting good grades and\n\nworking on ambitious projects of their own, I'd pick\n\nthe projects. And not because I'm an indulgent parent, but because\n\nI've been on the other end and I know which has more predictive\n\nvalue. When I was picking startups for Y Combinator, I didn't care\n\nabout applicants' grades. But if they'd worked on projects of their\n\nown, I wanted to hear all about those.\n\n[2]It may be inevitable that school is the way it is. I'm not saying\n\nwe have to redesign it (though I'm not saying we don't), just that\n\nwe should understand what it does to our attitudes to work — that\n\nit steers us toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often using\n\ncompetition as bait, and away from skating.There are occasionally times when schoolwork becomes a project of\n\none's own. Whenever I had to write a paper, that would become a\n\nproject of my own — except in English classes, ironically, because\n\nthe things one has to write in English classes are so\n\nbogus. And\n\nwhen I got to college and started taking CS classes, the programs\n\nI had to write became projects of my own. Whenever I was writing\n\nor programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true ever\n\nsince.So where exactly is the edge of projects of one's own? That's an\n\ninteresting question, partly because the answer is so complicated,\n\nand partly because there's so much at stake. There turn out to be\n\ntwo senses in which work can be one's own: 1) that you're doing it\n\nvoluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and\n\n2) that you're doing it by yourself.The edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about\n\ntheir work are usually very sensitive to the difference between\n\npulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one category\n\nor the other. But the test isn't simply whether you're told to do\n\nsomething. You can choose to do something you're told to do. Indeed,\n\nyou can own it far more thoroughly than the person who told you to\n\ndo it.For example, math homework is for most people something they're\n\ntold to do. But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn't.\n\nMost of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test\n\nor develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section.\n\nBut to my father the problems were the part that mattered, and the\n\ntext was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new math\n\nbook it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new set\n\nof problems to solve, and he'd immediately set about solving all\n\nof them.The other sense of a project being one's own — working on it by\n\noneself — has a much softer edge. It shades gradually into\n\ncollaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration in\n\ntwo different ways. One way to collaborate is to share a single\n\nproject. For example, when two mathematicians collaborate on a proof\n\nthat takes shape in the course of a conversation between them. The\n\nother way is when multiple people work on separate projects of their\n\nown that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. For example, when one\n\nperson writes the text of a book and another does the graphic design.\n\n[3]These two paths into collaboration can of course be combined. But\n\nunder the right conditions, the excitement of working on a project\n\nof one's own can be preserved for quite a while before disintegrating\n\ninto the turbulent flow of work in a large organization. Indeed,\n\nthe history of successful organizations is partly the history of\n\ntechniques for preserving that excitement.\n\n[4]The team that made the original Macintosh were a great example of\n\nthis phenomenon. People like Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld and\n\nBill Atkinson and Susan Kare were not just following orders. They\n\nwere not tennis balls hit by Steve Jobs, but rockets let loose by\n\nSteve Jobs. There was a lot of collaboration between them, but\n\nthey all seem to have individually felt the excitement of\n\nworking on a project of one's own.In Andy Hertzfeld's book on the Macintosh, he describes how they'd\n\ncome back into the office after dinner and work late into the night.\n\nPeople who've never experienced the thrill of working on a project\n\nthey're excited about can't distinguish this kind of working long\n\nhours from the kind that happens in sweatshops and boiler rooms,\n\nbut they're at opposite ends of the spectrum. That's why it's a\n\nmistake to insist dogmatically on \"work/life balance.\" Indeed, the\n\nmere expression \"work/life\" embodies a mistake: it assumes work and\n\nlife are distinct. For those to whom the word \"work\" automatically\n\nimplies the dutiful plodding kind, they are. But for the skaters,\n\nthe relationship between work and life would be better represented\n\nby a dash than a slash. I wouldn't want to work on anything that I didn't\n\nwant to take over my life.Of course, it's easier to achieve this level of motivation when\n\nyou're making something like the Macintosh. It's easy for something\n\nnew to feel like a project of your own. That's one of the reasons\n\nfor the tendency programmers have to rewrite things that don't need\n\nrewriting, and to write their own versions of things that already\n\nexist. This sometimes alarms managers, and measured by total number\n\nof characters typed, it's rarely the optimal solution. But it's not\n\nalways driven simply by arrogance or cluelessness.\n\nWriting code from scratch is also much more rewarding — so much\n\nmore rewarding that a good programmer can end up net ahead, despite\n\nthe shocking waste of characters. Indeed, it may be one of the\n\nadvantages of capitalism that it encourages such rewriting. A company\n\nthat needs software to do something can't use the software already\n\nwritten to do it at another company, and thus has to write their\n\nown, which often turns out better.\n\n[5]The natural alignment between skating and solving new problems is\n\none of the reasons the payoffs from startups are so high. Not only\n\nis the market price of unsolved problems higher, you also get a\n\ndiscount on productivity when you work on them. In fact, you get a\n\ndouble increase in productivity: when you're doing a clean-sheet\n\ndesign, it's easier to recruit skaters, and they get to spend all\n\ntheir time skating.Steve Jobs knew a thing or two about skaters from having watched\n\nSteve Wozniak. If you can find the right people, you only have to\n\ntell them what to do at the highest level. They'll handle the\n\ndetails. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like your\n\nown, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can't be working to\n\norder, or slowed down\n\nby bureaucracy.One way to ensure autonomy is not to have a boss at all. There are\n\ntwo ways to do that: to be the boss yourself, and to work on projects\n\noutside of work. Though they're at opposite ends of the scale\n\nfinancially, startups and open source projects have a lot in common,\n\nincluding the fact that they're often run by skaters. And indeed,\n\nthere's a wormhole from one end of the scale to the other: one of\n\nthe best ways to discover\n\nstartup ideas is to work on a project\n\njust for fun.If your projects are the kind that make money, it's easy to work\n\non them. It's harder when they're not. And the hardest part, usually,\n\nis morale. That's where adults have it harder than kids. Kids just\n\nplunge in and build their treehouse without worrying about whether\n\nthey're wasting their time, or how it compares to other treehouses.\n\nAnd frankly we could learn a lot from kids here. The high standards\n\nmost grownups have for \"real\" work do not always serve us well.The most important phase in a project of one's own is at the\n\nbeginning: when you go from thinking it might be cool to do x to\n\nactually doing x. And at that point high standards are not merely\n\nuseless but positively harmful. There are a few people who start\n\ntoo many new projects, but far more, I suspect, who are deterred\n\nby fear of failure from starting projects that would have succeeded\n\nif they had.But if we couldn't benefit as kids from the knowledge that our\n\ntreehouses were on the path to grownup projects, we can at least\n\nbenefit as grownups from knowing that our projects are on a path\n\nthat stretches back to treehouses. Remember that careless confidence\n\nyou had as a kid when starting something new? That would be a\n\npowerful thing to recapture.If it's harder as adults to retain that kind of confidence, we at\n\nleast tend to be more aware of what we're doing. Kids bounce, or\n\nare herded, from one kind of work to the next, barely realizing\n\nwhat's happening to them. Whereas we know more about different types\n\nof work and have more control over which we do. Ideally we can have\n\nthe best of both worlds: to be deliberate in choosing to work on\n\nprojects of our own, and carelessly confident in starting new ones.\n\nNotes[1]\n\n\"Hobby\" is a curious word. Now it means work that isn't real\n\nwork — work that one is not to be judged by — but originally it just\n\nmeant an obsession in a fairly general sense (even a political\n\nopinion, for example) that one metaphorically rode as a child rides\n\na hobby-horse. It's hard to say if its recent, narrower meaning is\n\na change for the better or the worse. For sure there are lots of\n\nfalse positives — lots of projects that end up being important but\n\nare dismissed initially as mere hobbies. But on the other hand, the\n\nconcept provides valuable cover for projects in the early, ugly\n\nduckling phase.[2]\n\nTiger parents, as parents so often do, are fighting the last\n\nwar. Grades mattered more in the old days when the route to success\n\nwas to acquire\n\ncredentials\n\nwhile ascending some predefined ladder.\n\nBut it's just as well that their tactics are focused on grades. How\n\nawful it would be if they invaded the territory of projects, and\n\nthereby gave their kids a distaste for this kind of work by forcing\n\nthem to do it. Grades are already a grim, fake world, and aren't\n\nharmed much by parental interference, but working on one's own\n\nprojects is a more delicate, private thing that could be damaged\n\nvery easily.[3]\n\nThe complicated, gradual edge between working on one's own\n\nprojects and collaborating with others is one reason there is so\n\nmuch disagreement about the idea of the \"lone genius.\" In practice\n\npeople collaborate (or not) in all kinds of different ways, but the\n\nidea of the lone genius is definitely not a myth. There's a core\n\nof truth to it that goes with a certain way of working.[4]\n\nCollaboration is powerful too. The optimal organization would\n\ncombine collaboration and ownership in such a way as to do the least\n\ndamage to each. Interestingly, companies and university departments\n\napproach this ideal from opposite directions: companies insist on\n\ncollaboration, and occasionally also manage both to recruit skaters\n\nand allow them to skate, and university departments insist on the\n\nability to do independent research (which is by custom treated as\n\nskating, whether it is or not), and the people they hire collaborate\n\nas much as they choose.[5]\n\nIf a company could design its software in such a way that the\n\nbest newly arrived programmers always got a clean sheet, it could\n\nhave a kind of eternal youth. That might not be impossible. If you\n\nhad a software backbone defining a game with sufficiently clear\n\nrules, individual programmers could write their own players.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 2462, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:35.280608Z"}
{"id": "fn", "title": "Fierce Nerds", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/fn.html", "date": null, "content": "May 2021Most people think of nerds as quiet, diffident people. In ordinary\n\nsocial situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star\n\nquarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics\n\nsymposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water.\n\nBut the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact\n\nthat when non-nerds observe them, it's usually in ordinary social\n\nsituations. In fact some nerds are quite fierce.The fierce nerds are a small but interesting group. They are as a\n\nrule extremely competitive — more competitive, I'd say, than highly\n\ncompetitive non-nerds. Competition is more personal for them. Partly\n\nperhaps because they're not emotionally mature enough to distance\n\nthemselves from it, but also because there's less randomness in the\n\nkinds of competition they engage in, and they are thus more justified\n\nin taking the results personally.Fierce nerds also tend to be somewhat overconfident, especially\n\nwhen young. It might seem like it would be a disadvantage to be\n\nmistaken about one's abilities, but empirically it isn't. Up to a\n\npoint, confidence is a self-fullfilling prophecy.Another quality you find in most fierce nerds is intelligence. Not\n\nall nerds are smart, but the fierce ones are always at least\n\nmoderately so. If they weren't, they wouldn't have the confidence\n\nto be fierce.\n\n[1]There's also a natural connection between nerdiness and\n\nindependent-mindedness. It's hard to be\n\nindependent-minded without\n\nbeing somewhat socially awkward, because conventional beliefs are\n\nso often mistaken, or at least arbitrary. No one who was both\n\nindependent-minded and ambitious would want to waste the effort it\n\ntakes to fit in. And the independent-mindedness of the fierce nerds\n\nwill obviously be of the aggressive\n\nrather than the passive type:\n\nthey'll be annoyed by rules, rather than dreamily unaware of them.I'm less sure why fierce nerds are impatient, but most seem to be.\n\nYou notice it first in conversation, where they tend to interrupt\n\nyou. This is merely annoying, but in the more promising fierce nerds\n\nit's connected to a deeper impatience about solving problems. Perhaps\n\nthe competitiveness and impatience of fierce nerds are not separate\n\nqualities, but two manifestations of a single underlying drivenness.When you combine all these qualities in sufficient quantities, the\n\nresult is quite formidable. The most vivid example of fierce nerds\n\nin action may be James Watson's The Double Helix. The first sentence\n\nof the book is \"I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood,\"\n\nand the portrait he goes on to paint of Crick is the quintessential\n\nfierce nerd: brilliant, socially awkward, competitive, independent-minded,\n\noverconfident. But so is the implicit portrait he paints of himself.\n\nIndeed, his lack of social awareness makes both portraits that much\n\nmore realistic, because he baldly states all sorts of opinions and\n\nmotivations that a smoother person would conceal. And moreover it's\n\nclear from the story that Crick and Watson's fierce nerdiness was\n\nintegral to their success. Their independent-mindedness caused them\n\nto consider approaches that most others ignored, their overconfidence\n\nallowed them to work on problems they only half understood (they\n\nwere literally described as \"clowns\" by one eminent insider), and\n\ntheir impatience and competitiveness got them to the answer ahead\n\nof two other groups that would otherwise have found it within the\n\nnext year, if not the next several months.\n\n[2]The idea that there could be fierce nerds is an unfamiliar one not\n\njust to many normal people but even to some young nerds. Especially\n\nearly on, nerds spend so much of their time in ordinary social\n\nsituations and so little doing real work that they get a lot more\n\nevidence of their awkwardness than their power. So there will be\n\nsome who read this description of the fierce nerd and realize \"Hmm,\n\nthat's me.\" And it is to you, young fierce nerd, that I now turn.I have some good news, and some bad news. The good news is that\n\nyour fierceness will be a great help in solving difficult problems.\n\nAnd not just the kind of scientific and technical problems that\n\nnerds have traditionally solved. As the world progresses, the number\n\nof things you can win at by getting the right answer increases.\n\nRecently getting rich became\n\none of them: 7 of the 8 richest people\n\nin America are now fierce nerds.Indeed, being a fierce nerd is probably even more helpful in business\n\nthan in nerds' original territory of scholarship. Fierceness seems\n\noptional there. Darwin for example doesn't seem to have been\n\nespecially fierce. Whereas it's impossible to be the CEO of a company\n\nover a certain size without being fierce, so now that nerds can win\n\nat business, fierce nerds will increasingly monopolize the really\n\nbig successes.The bad news is that if it's not exercised, your fierceness will\n\nturn to bitterness, and you will become an intellectual playground\n\nbully: the grumpy sysadmin, the forum troll, the\n\nhater, the shooter\n\ndown of new ideas.How do you avoid this fate? Work on ambitious projects. If you\n\nsucceed, it will bring you a kind of satisfaction that neutralizes\n\nbitterness. But you don't need to have succeeded to feel this;\n\nmerely working on hard projects gives most fierce nerds some\n\nfeeling of satisfaction. And those it doesn't, it at least keeps\n\nbusy.\n\n[3]Another solution may be to somehow turn off your fierceness, by\n\ndevoting yourself to meditation or psychotherapy or something like\n\nthat. Maybe that's the right answer for some people. I have no idea.\n\nBut it doesn't seem the optimal solution to me. If you're given a\n\nsharp knife, it seems to me better to use it than to blunt its edge\n\nto avoid cutting yourself.If you do choose the ambitious route, you'll have a tailwind behind\n\nyou. There has never been a better time to be a nerd. In the past\n\ncentury we've seen a continuous transfer of power from dealmakers\n\nto technicians — from the charismatic to the competent — and I\n\ndon't see anything on the horizon that will end it. At least not\n\ntill the nerds end it themselves by bringing about the singularity.Notes[1]\n\nTo be a nerd is to be socially awkward, and there are two\n\ndistinct ways to do that: to be playing the same game as everyone\n\nelse, but badly, and to be playing a different game. The smart nerds\n\nare the latter type.[2]\n\nThe same qualities that make fierce nerds so effective can\n\nalso make them very annoying. Fierce nerds would do well to remember\n\nthis, and (a) try to keep a lid on it, and (b) seek out organizations\n\nand types of work where getting the right answer matters more than\n\npreserving social harmony. In practice that means small groups\n\nworking on hard problems. Which fortunately is the most fun kind\n\nof environment anyway.[3]\n\nIf success neutralizes bitterness, why are there some people\n\nwho are at least moderately successful and yet still quite bitter?\n\nBecause people's potential bitterness varies depending on how\n\nnaturally bitter their personality is, and how ambitious they are:\n\nsomeone who's naturally very bitter will still have a lot left after\n\nsuccess neutralizes some of it, and someone who's very ambitious\n\nwill need proportionally more success to satisfy that ambition.So the worst-case scenario is someone who's both naturally bitter\n\nand extremely ambitious, and yet only moderately successful.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1209, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:35.887136Z"}
{"id": "newideas", "title": "Crazy New Ideas", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/newideas.html", "date": null, "content": "May 2021There's one kind of opinion I'd be very afraid to express publicly.\n\nIf someone I knew to be both a domain expert and a reasonable person\n\nproposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant\n\nto say \"That will never work.\"Anyone who has studied the history of ideas, and especially the\n\nhistory of science, knows that's how big things start. Someone\n\nproposes an idea that sounds crazy, most people dismiss it, then\n\nit gradually takes over the world.Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely\n\ndismissed. But not when they're proposed by reasonable domain\n\nexperts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they\n\nknow how implausible it sounds. And yet they're proposing it anyway.\n\nThat suggests they know something you don't. And if they have deep\n\ndomain expertise, that's probably the source of it.\n\n[1]Such ideas are not merely unsafe to dismiss, but disproportionately\n\nlikely to be interesting. When the average person proposes an\n\nimplausible-sounding idea, its implausibility is evidence of their\n\nincompetence. But when a reasonable domain expert does it, the\n\nsituation is reversed. There's something like an efficient market\n\nhere: on average the ideas that seem craziest will, if correct,\n\nhave the biggest effect. So if you can eliminate the theory that\n\nthe person proposing an implausible-sounding idea is incompetent,\n\nits implausibility switches from evidence that it's boring to\n\nevidence that it's exciting.\n\n[2]Such ideas are not guaranteed to work. But they don't have to be.\n\nThey just have to be sufficiently good bets — to have sufficiently\n\nhigh expected value. And I think on average they do. I think if you\n\nbet on the entire set of implausible-sounding ideas proposed by\n\nreasonable domain experts, you'd end up net ahead.The reason is that everyone is too conservative. The word \"paradigm\"\n\nis overused, but this is a case where it's warranted. Everyone is\n\ntoo much in the grip of the current paradigm. Even the people who\n\nhave the new ideas undervalue them initially. Which means that\n\nbefore they reach the stage of proposing them publicly, they've\n\nalready subjected them to an excessively strict filter.\n\n[3]The wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but\n\nto ask questions, because there's a real mystery here. Why has this\n\nsmart and reasonable person proposed an idea that seems so wrong?\n\nAre they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be. If you're the\n\none who's mistaken, that would be good to know, because it means\n\nthere's a hole in your model of the world. But even if they're\n\nmistaken, it should be interesting to learn why. A trap that an\n\nexpert falls into is one you have to worry about too.This all seems pretty obvious. And yet there are clearly a lot of\n\npeople who don't share my fear of dismissing new ideas. Why do they\n\ndo it? Why risk looking like a jerk now and a fool later, instead\n\nof just reserving judgement?One reason they do it is envy. If you propose a radical new idea\n\nand it succeeds, your reputation (and perhaps also your wealth)\n\nwill increase proportionally. Some people would be envious if that\n\nhappened, and this potential envy propagates back into a conviction\n\nthat you must be wrong.Another reason people dismiss new ideas is that it's an easy way\n\nto seem sophisticated. When a new idea first emerges, it usually\n\nseems pretty feeble. It's a mere hatchling. Received wisdom is a\n\nfull-grown eagle by comparison. So it's easy to launch a devastating\n\nattack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever to those\n\nwho don't understand this asymmetry.This phenomenon is exacerbated by the difference between how those\n\nworking on new ideas and those attacking them are rewarded. The\n\nrewards for working on new ideas are weighted by the value of the\n\noutcome. So it's worth working on something that only has a 10%\n\nchance of succeeding if it would make things more than 10x better.\n\nWhereas the rewards for attacking new ideas are roughly constant;\n\nsuch attacks seem roughly equally clever regardless of the target.People will also attack new ideas when they have a vested interest\n\nin the old ones. It's not surprising, for example, that some of\n\nDarwin's harshest critics were churchmen. People build whole careers\n\non some ideas. When someone claims they're false or obsolete, they\n\nfeel threatened.The lowest form of dismissal is mere factionalism: to automatically\n\ndismiss any idea associated with the opposing faction. The lowest\n\nform of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.But the main thing that leads reasonable people to dismiss new ideas\n\nis the same thing that holds people back from proposing them: the\n\nsheer pervasiveness of the current paradigm. It doesn't just affect\n\nthe way we think; it is the Lego blocks we build thoughts out of.\n\nPopping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people\n\ncan do. And even they usually have to suppress their intuitions at\n\nfirst, like a pilot flying through cloud who has to trust his\n\ninstruments over his sense of balance.\n\n[4]Paradigms don't just define our present thinking. They also vacuum\n\nup the trail of crumbs that led to them, making our standards for\n\nnew ideas impossibly high. The current paradigm seems so perfect\n\nto us, its offspring, that we imagine it must have been accepted\n\ncompletely as soon as it was discovered — that whatever the church thought\n\nof the heliocentric model, astronomers must have been convinced as\n\nsoon as Copernicus proposed it. Far, in fact, from it. Copernicus\n\npublished the heliocentric model in 1532, but it wasn't till the\n\nmid seventeenth century that the balance of scientific opinion\n\nshifted in its favor.\n\n[5]Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear.\n\nSo if you want to have new ideas yourself, one of the most valuable\n\nthings you can do is to learn what they look like when they're born.\n\nRead about how new ideas happened, and try to get yourself into the\n\nheads of people at the time. How did things look to them, when the\n\nnew idea was only half-finished, and even the person who had it was\n\nonly half-convinced it was right?But you don't have to stop at history. You can observe big new ideas\n\nbeing born all around you right now. Just look for a reasonable\n\ndomain expert proposing something that sounds wrong.If you're nice, as well as wise, you won't merely resist attacking\n\nsuch people, but encourage them. Having new ideas is a lonely\n\nbusiness. Only those who've tried it know how lonely. These people\n\nneed your help. And if you help them, you'll probably learn something\n\nin the process.Notes[1]\n\nThis domain expertise could be in another field. Indeed,\n\nsuch crossovers tend to be particularly promising.[2]\n\nI'm not claiming this principle extends much beyond math,\n\nengineering, and the hard sciences. In politics, for example,\n\ncrazy-sounding ideas generally are as bad as they sound. Though\n\narguably this is not an exception, because the people who propose\n\nthem are not in fact domain experts; politicians are domain experts\n\nin political tactics, like how to get elected and how to get\n\nlegislation passed, but not in the world that policy acts upon.\n\nPerhaps no one could be.[3]\n\nThis sense of \"paradigm\" was defined by Thomas Kuhn in his\n\nStructure of Scientific Revolutions, but I also recommend his\n\nCopernican Revolution, where you can see him at work developing the\n\nidea.[4]\n\nThis is one reason people with a touch of Asperger's may have\n\nan advantage in discovering new ideas.

But in\n\npractice the debate about the death penalty is not about whether\n\nit's ok to kill murderers. It's about whether it's ok to kill\n\ninnocent people, because at least 4% of people on death row are\n\ninnocent.When I was a kid I imagined that it was unusual for people to be\n\nconvicted of crimes they hadn't committed, and that in murder cases\n\nespecially this must be very rare. Far from it. Now, thanks to\n\norganizations like the\n\nInnocence Project,\n\nwe see a constant stream\n\nof stories about murder convictions being overturned after new\n\nevidence emerges. Sometimes the police and prosecutors were just\n\nvery sloppy. Sometimes they were crooked, and knew full well they\n\nwere convicting an innocent person.Kenneth Adams and three other men spent 18 years in prison on a\n\nmurder conviction. They were exonerated after DNA testing implicated\n\nthree different men, two of whom later confessed. The police had\n\nbeen told about the other men early in the investigation, but never\n\nfollowed up the lead.Keith Harward spent 33 years in prison on a murder conviction. He\n\nwas convicted because \"experts\" said his teeth matched photos of\n\nbite marks on one victim. He was exonerated after DNA testing showed\n\nthe murder had been committed by another man, Jerry Crotty.Ricky Jackson and two other men spent 39 years in prison after being\n\nconvicted of murder on the testimony of a 12 year old boy, who later\n\nrecanted and said he'd been coerced by police. Multiple people have\n\nconfirmed the boy was elsewhere at the time. The three men were\n\nexonerated after the county prosecutor dropped the charges, saying\n\n\"The state is conceding the obvious.\"Alfred Brown spent 12 years in prison on a murder conviction,\n\nincluding 10 years on death row. He was exonerated after it was\n\ndiscovered that the assistant district attorney had concealed phone\n\nrecords proving he could not have committed the crimes.Glenn Ford spent 29 years on death row after having been convicted\n\nof murder. He was exonerated after new evidence proved he was not\n\neven at the scene when the murder occurred. The attorneys assigned\n\nto represent him had never tried a jury case before.Cameron Willingham was actually executed in 2004 by lethal injection.\n\nThe \"expert\" who testified that he deliberately set fire to his\n\nhouse has since been discredited. A re-examination of the case\n\nordered by the state of Texas in 2009 concluded that \"a finding of\n\narson could not be sustained.\"Rich Glossip\n\nhas spent 20 years on death row after being convicted\n\nof murder on the testimony of the actual killer, who escaped with\n\na life sentence in return for implicating him. In 2015 he came\n\nwithin minutes of execution before it emerged that Oklahoma had\n\nbeen planning to kill him with an illegal combination of drugs.\n\nThey still plan to go ahead with the execution, perhaps as soon as\n\nthis summer, despite\n\nnew\n\nevidence exonerating him.I could go on. There are hundreds of similar cases. In Florida\n\nalone, 29 death row prisoners have been exonerated so far.Far from being rare, wrongful murder convictions are\n\nvery common.\n\nPolice are under pressure to solve a crime that has gotten a lot\n\nof attention. When they find a suspect, they want to believe he's\n\nguilty, and ignore or even destroy evidence suggesting otherwise.\n\nDistrict attorneys want to be seen as effective and tough on crime,\n\nand in order to win convictions are willing to manipulate witnesses\n\nand withhold evidence. Court-appointed defense attorneys are\n\noverworked and often incompetent. There's a ready supply of criminals\n\nwilling to give false testimony in return for a lighter sentence,\n\nsuggestible witnesses who can be made to say whatever police want,\n\nand bogus \"experts\" eager to claim that science proves the defendant\n\nis guilty. And juries want to believe them, since otherwise some\n\nterrible crime remains unsolved.This circus of incompetence and dishonesty is the real issue with\n\nthe death penalty. We don't even reach the point where theoretical\n\nquestions about the moral justification or effectiveness of capital\n\npunishment start to matter, because so many of the people sentenced\n\nto death are actually innocent.

If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to\n\nthe 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences.In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the\n\n100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10\n\ndu Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in\n\nhalf, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes.Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance\n\ntaxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this\n\nperiod. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not\n\nthat fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more\n\npeople are making them.How are people making these new fortunes?

Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56\n\nderive from founders' or early employees' equity (52 founders, 2\n\nearly employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing\n\ninvestment funds.There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982.\n\nHedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none of\n\ntheir founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100.\n\nTwo things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate\n\nhigh returns, and more investors were willing to trust them with\n\ntheir money.\n\n[1]But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and\n\nwhen you look at the data, you see big changes there too. People\n\nget richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, because\n\nthe companies do different things.In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and\n\nreal estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due\n\nprimarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: of\n\nthe 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2\n\nto oil.By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes\n\ncalled \"tech\" companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive\n\nfrom such companies. These are particularly common among the richest\n\nof the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of\n\nthis type.Arguably it's slightly misleading to treat tech as a category.\n\nIsn't Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no.\n\nMaybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it\n\nwon't seem right to put these two businesses in the same category.\n\nBut at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share\n\nin common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What\n\ncar maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company?The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a\n\nwell-differentiated group in the sense that they're all companies\n\nthat venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others\n\nmostly not. And there's a reason why: these are mostly companies\n\nthat win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who's\n\nreally driven and good at making deals.To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative\n\nchange. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400\n\ndidn't win by making better technology. They won by being really\n\ndriven and good at making deals.\n\n[2]\n\nAnd indeed, that way of\n\ngetting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European\n\nroyal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule,\n\nreally driven and good at making deals.People who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look\n\nback on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who\n\ngot rich then didn't get as rich. But if you dig into how they\n\ngot rich, the old days don't look so good. In 1982, 84% of the\n\nrichest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural\n\nresources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than\n\na world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech\n\ncompanies?Why are people starting so many more new companies than they used\n\nto, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to the\n\nfirst question, curiously enough, is that it's misphrased. We\n\nshouldn't be asking why people are starting companies, but why\n\nthey're starting companies again.\n\n[3]In 1892, the New York Herald Tribune compiled a list of all the\n\nmillionaires in America. They found 4047 of them. How many had\n\ninherited their wealth then? Only about 20%, which is less than the\n\nproportion of heirs today. And when you investigate the sources of\n\nthe new fortunes, 1892 looks even more like today. Hugh Rockoff\n\nfound that \"many of the richest ... gained their initial edge from\n\nthe new technology of mass production.\"\n\n[4]So it's not 2020 that's the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question\n\nis why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in\n\n1982. And the answer is that even as the Herald Tribune's list was\n\nbeing compiled, a wave of consolidation\n\nwas sweeping through the\n\nAmerican economy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,\n\nfinanciers like J. P. Morgan combined thousands of smaller companies\n\ninto a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of scale.\n\nBy the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, \"the major\n\nsectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed\n\ncartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations.\"\n\n[5]In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have\n\ngone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting your\n\nown company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really a\n\nviable option. You couldn't break through the oligopolies to get\n\nat the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960 was not to start\n\nyour own company, but to work your way up the corporate ladder at\n\nan existing one.\n\n[6]Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality\n\n(and every other kind of variation), but if your model of normal\n\nis the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading model in that\n\nrespect. J. P. Morgan's economy turned out to be just a phase, and\n\nstarting in the 1970s, it began to break up.Why did it break up? Partly senescence. The big companies that\n\nseemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had by 1970 become\n\nslack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the economy was\n\nfull of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulate\n\nthemselves from market forces. During the Carter administration the\n\nfederal government realized something was amiss and began, in a\n\nprocess they called \"deregulation,\" to roll back the policies that\n\npropped up the oligopolies.But it wasn't just decay from within that broke up J. P. Morgan's\n\neconomy. There was also pressure from without, in the form of new\n\ntechnology, and particularly microelectronics. The best way to\n\nenvision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice on\n\ntop. Initially the only way from the bottom to the surface is around\n\nthe edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you start to be able to\n\npunch right through the middle.The edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actually\n\ndescribed themselves as being in the electronics or software business.\n\nWhen you used the word \"startup\" in 1990, that was what you meant.\n\nBut now startups are punching right through the middle of the ice\n\ncrust and displacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks and\n\ncar companies.\n\n[7]But though the breakup of J. P. Morgan's economy created a new world\n\nin the technological sense, it was a reversion to the norm in the\n\nsocial sense. If you only look back as far as the mid 20th century,\n\nit seems like people getting rich by starting their own companies\n\nis a recent phenomenon. But if you look back further, you realize\n\nit's actually the default. So what we should expect in the future\n\nis more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number and\n\nwealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to\n\nstart a startup.Part of the reason it's getting easier to start a startup is social.\n\nSociety is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your\n\nparents won't freak out the way they would have a generation ago,\n\nand knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the\n\nmain reason it's easier to start a startup now is that it's cheaper.\n\nTechnology has driven down the cost of both building products and\n\nacquiring customers.The decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed the\n\nbalance of power between founders and investors. Back when starting\n\na startup meant building a factory, you needed investors' permission\n\nto do it at all. But now investors need founders more than founders\n\nneed investors, and that, combined with the increasing amount of\n\nventure capital available, has driven up valuations.\n\n[8]So the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the number\n\nof rich people in two ways: it means that more people start them,\n\nand that those who do can raise money on better terms.But there's also a third factor at work: the companies themselves\n\nare more valuable, because newly founded companies grow faster than\n\nthey used to. Technology hasn't just made it cheaper to build and\n\ndistribute things, but faster too.This trend has been running for a long time. IBM, founded in 1896,\n\ntook 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue.\n\nHewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, founded\n\nin 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is\n\n7 or 8 years.\n\n[9]Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders' stock.\n\nThe value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth\n\nrate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion\n\ndollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when\n\nit reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower.That's why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low\n\ninitial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young,\n\nand the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed\n\nthey could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.It's easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been.\n\nThat means more people start them, that those who do get better\n\nterms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more\n\nvaluable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that\n\nstartups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don't\n\nhave to resort to some vague right turn the country took under\n\nReagan to explain why America's Gini coefficient is increasing. Of\n\ncourse the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting\n\nmore valuable companies, how could it not be?Notes[1]\n\nInvestment firms grew rapidly after a regulatory change by\n\nthe Labor Department in 1978 allowed pension funds to invest in\n\nthem, but the effects of this growth were not yet visible in the\n\ntop 100 fortunes in 1982.[2]\n\nGeorge Mitchell deserves mention as an exception. Though\n\nreally driven and good at making deals, he was also the first to\n\nfigure out how to use fracking to get natural gas out of shale.[3]\n\nWhen I say people are starting more companies, I mean the\n\ntype of company meant to grow\n\nvery big. There has actually been a\n\ndecrease in the last couple decades in the overall number of new\n\ncompanies. But the vast majority of companies are small retail and\n\nservice businesses. So what the statistics about the decreasing\n\nnumber of new businesses mean is that people are starting fewer\n\nshoe stores and barber shops.People sometimes get confused when they see a graph labelled\n\n\"startups\" that's going down, because there are two senses of the\n\nword \"startup\": (1) the founding of a company, and (2) a particular\n\ntype of company designed to grow big fast. The statistics mean\n\nstartup in sense (1), not sense (2).[4]\n\nRockoff, Hugh. \"Great Fortunes of the Gilded Age.\" NBER Working\n\nPaper 14555, 2008.[5]\n\nLind, Michael. Land of Promise. HarperCollins, 2012.It's also likely that the high tax rates in the mid 20th century\n\ndeterred people from starting their own companies. Starting one's\n\nown company is risky, and when risk isn't rewarded, people opt for\n\nsafety instead.But it wasn't simply cause and effect. The oligopolies and high tax\n\nrates of the mid 20th century were all of a piece. Lower taxes are\n\nnot just a cause of entrepreneurship, but an effect as well: the\n\npeople getting rich in the mid 20th century from real estate and\n\noil exploration lobbied for and got huge tax loopholes that made\n\ntheir effective tax rate much lower, and presumably if it had been\n\nmore common to grow big companies by building new technology, the\n\npeople doing that would have lobbied for their own loopholes as\n\nwell.[6]\n\nThat's why the people who did get rich in the mid 20th century\n\nso often got rich from oil exploration or real estate. Those were\n\nthe two big areas of the economy that weren't susceptible to\n\nconsolidation.[7]\n\nThe pure tech companies used to be called \"high technology\" startups.\n\nBut now that startups can punch through the middle of the ice crust,\n\nwe don't need a separate name for the edges, and the term \"high-tech\"\n\nhas a decidedly retro\n\nsound.[8]\n\nHigher valuations mean you either sell less stock to get a\n\ngiven amount of money, or get more money for a given amount of\n\nstock. The typical startup does some of each. Obviously you end up\n\nricher if you keep more stock, but you should also end up richer\n\nif you raise more money, because (a) it should make the company\n\nmore successful, and (b) you should be able to last longer before\n\nthe next round, or not even need one. Notice all those shoulds\n\nthough. In practice a lot of money slips through them.It might seem that the huge rounds raised by startups nowadays\n\ncontradict the claim that it has become cheaper to start one. But\n\nthere's no contradiction here; the startups that raise the most are\n\nthe ones doing it by choice, in order to grow faster, not the ones\n\ndoing it because they need the money to survive. There's nothing\n\nlike not needing money to make people offer it to you.You would think, after having been on the side of labor in its fight\n\nwith capital for almost two centuries, that the far left would be\n\nhappy that labor has finally prevailed. But none of them seem to\n\nbe. You can almost hear them saying \"No, no, not that way.\"[9]\n\nIBM was created in 1911 by merging three companies, the most\n\nimportant of which was Herman Hollerith's Tabulating Machine Company,\n\nfounded in 1896.

The less\n\nenergy they expend on your prose, the more they'll have left for\n\nyour ideas.And the further they'll read. Most readers' energy tends to flag\n\npart way through an article or essay. If the friction of reading\n\nis low enough, more keep going till the end.There's an Italian dish called saltimbocca, which means \"leap\n\ninto the mouth.\" My goal when writing might be called saltintesta:\n\nthe ideas leap into your head and you barely notice the words that\n\ngot them there.It's too much to hope that writing could ever be pure ideas. You\n\nmight not even want it to be. But for most writers, most of the\n\ntime, that's the goal to aim for. The gap between most writing and\n\npure ideas is not filled with poetry.Plus it's more considerate to write simply. When you write in a\n\nfancy way to impress people, you're making them do extra work just\n\nso you can seem cool. It's like trailing a long train behind you\n\nthat readers have to carry.And remember, if you're writing in English, that a lot of your\n\nreaders won't be native English speakers. Their understanding of\n\nideas may be way ahead of their understanding of English. So you\n\ncan't assume that writing about a difficult topic means you can\n\nuse difficult words.Of course, fancy writing doesn't just conceal ideas. It can also\n\nconceal the lack of them. That's why some people write that way,\n\nto conceal the fact that they have\n\nnothing to say. Whereas writing\n\nsimply keeps you honest. If you say nothing simply, it will be\n\nobvious to everyone, including you.Simple writing also lasts better. People reading your stuff in the\n\nfuture will be in much the same position as people from other\n\ncountries reading it today. The culture and the language will have\n\nchanged.

When I write a sentence that seems too complicated,\n\nor that uses unnecessarily intellectual words, it doesn't seem fancy\n\nto me. It seems clumsy.There are of course times when you want to use a complicated sentence\n\nor fancy word for effect. But you should never do it by accident.The other reason my writing ends up being simple is the way I do\n\nit.

{"id": "donate", "title": "Donate Unrestricted", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/donate.html", "date": null, "content": "March 2021The secret curse of the nonprofit world is restricted donations.\n\nIf you haven't been involved with nonprofits, you may never have\n\nheard this phrase before. But if you have been, it probably made\n\nyou wince.Restricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what can\n\nbe done with the money. This is common with big donations, perhaps\n\nthe default. And yet it's usually a bad idea. Usually the way the\n\ndonor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would have\n\nchosen. Otherwise there would have been no need to restrict the\n\ndonation. But who has a better understanding of where money needs\n\nto be spent, the nonprofit or the donor?If a nonprofit doesn't understand better than its donors where money\n\nneeds to be spent, then it's incompetent and you shouldn't be\n\ndonating to it at all.Which means a restricted donation is inherently suboptimal. It's\n\neither a donation to a bad nonprofit, or a donation for the wrong\n\nthings.There are a couple exceptions to this principle. One is when the\n\nnonprofit is an umbrella organization. It's reasonable to make a\n\nrestricted donation to a university, for example, because a university\n\nis only nominally a single nonprofit. Another exception is when the\n\ndonor actually does know as much as the nonprofit about where money\n\nneeds to be spent. The Gates Foundation, for example, has specific\n\ngoals and often makes restricted donations to individual nonprofits\n\nto accomplish them. But unless you're a domain expert yourself or\n\ndonating to an umbrella organization, your donation would do more\n\ngood if it were unrestricted.If restricted donations do less good than unrestricted ones, why\n\ndo donors so often make them? Partly because doing good isn't donors'\n\nonly motive. They often have other motives as well — to make a mark,\n\nor to generate good publicity\n\n[1],\n\nor to comply with regulations\n\nor corporate policies. Many donors may simply never have considered\n\nthe distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations. They\n\nmay believe that donating money for some specific purpose is just\n\nhow donation works. And to be fair, nonprofits don't try very hard\n\nto discourage such illusions. They can't afford to. People running\n\nnonprofits are almost always anxious about money. They can't afford\n\nto talk back to big donors.You can't expect candor in a relationship so asymmetric. So I'll\n\ntell you what nonprofits wish they could tell you. If you want to\n\ndonate to a nonprofit, donate unrestricted. If you trust them to\n\nspend your money, trust them to decide how.\n\nNote[1]\n\nUnfortunately restricted donations tend to generate more\n\npublicity than unrestricted ones. \"X donates money to build a school\n\nin Africa\" is not only more interesting than \"X donates money to Y\n\nnonprofit to spend as Y chooses,\" but also focuses more attention\n\non X.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 461, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:39.523716Z"}
{"id": "worked", "title": "What I Worked On", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/worked.html", "date": null, "content": "February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,\n\nwere writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what\n\nbeginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still\n\nare: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,\n\njust characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them\n\ndeep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our\n\nschool district used for what was then called \"data processing.\"\n\nThis was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's\n\n1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and\n\nmy friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like\n\na mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking\n\nmachines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up\n\non a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to\n\ntype programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader\n\nand press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The\n\nresult would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly\n\nloud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with\n\nit. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it.\n\nThe only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,\n\nand I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other\n\noption was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate\n\napproximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything\n\ninteresting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any\n\nprograms I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest\n\nmemory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not\n\nto terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without\n\ntime-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as\n\nthe data center manager's expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a\n\ncomputer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond\n\nto your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through\n\na stack of punch cards and then stopping.\n\n[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.\n\nIt was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed\n\nand envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing\n\nprograms right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of\n\nnagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about\n\n1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was\n\ngood enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote\n\nsimple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would\n\nfly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one\n\nbook. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so\n\nhe'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a\n\nlot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college.\n\nIn college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more\n\npowerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study\n\nof the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in\n\nother fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when\n\nI got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the\n\nspace of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed\n\nultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases\n\nthat people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at\n\nthe time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept\n\nbeing boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things\n\nespecially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein\n\ncalled The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent\n\ncomputer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry\n\nWinograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh\n\nMistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it\n\nI was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of\n\ntime before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,\n\nit seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had\n\nto do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate\n\nclasses, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning\n\nLisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.\n\nThe commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,\n\nand programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at\n\nCornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation\n\nwas similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program\n\nso fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where\n\nthe new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had\n\nexpected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was\n\nsupposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a\n\nroll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God\n\ndid I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,\n\nbut what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine\n\nnow, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the\n\nlower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose\n\na major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose\n\nwhatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial\n\nIntelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed\n\nto find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as\n\nscare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly\n\naccurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for\n\nAI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves\n\nwent there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the\n\ntype of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,\n\nso that was where I went.I don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a\n\nspecific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized\n\nthat AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the\n\nsort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on\n\nthe chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds\n\nit to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of\n\nnatural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset.\n\nIt was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they\n\ncould do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,\n\nin fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole\n\nway of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,\n\nwas not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,\n\ngenerate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various\n\nband-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to\n\nget us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage\n\nof my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp\n\nwas interesting for its own sake and not just for its association\n\nwith AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about\n\nit at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided\n\nto write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little\n\nI knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But\n\nthere's nothing like writing a book about something to help you\n\nlearn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote\n\nmuch of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory\n\nand systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people\n\nbuild things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for\n\ntheory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable\n\nof the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last.\n\nAny program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete\n\nin a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in\n\nfootnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would\n\nseem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of\n\nthe field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer\n\nlab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could\n\nhave one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present\n\nstandards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so\n\noff they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would\n\nlast.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at\n\nCMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the\n\nCarnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While\n\nlooking at a painting there I realized something that might seem\n\nobvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,\n\nwas something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't\n\nbecome obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not\n\nas easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought\n\nif you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to\n\nbe possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could\n\nbe truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get\n\nresearch funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had\n\nno idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually\n\nthat people made art  that it didn't just appear spontaneously\n\n but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.\n\nThey either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange\n\nthings in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being\n\nable to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost\n\nmiraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students\n\ncould take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,\n\nwas very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I\n\nwas taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to\n\nbe an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and\n\nworking away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,\n\nI was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my\n\nthesis.I didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out\n\nof grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember\n\nwhen my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing\n\nthe internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a\n\nspectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into\n\nprofessor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate\n\nthat June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in\n\nwhat must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I\n\ndecided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that\n\nremained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I\n\ncould, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes,\n\nI think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect\n\nI should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's\n\na whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted\n\nwas to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation\n\nsufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in\n\nthe US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because\n\nit was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted\n\nme, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence\n\nI went.I'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that\n\nI had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,\n\nbecause I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different\n\nages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do\n\nthe foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that\n\neveryone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,\n\nand design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from\n\nthe Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to\n\nCambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me\n\nto take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only\n\nweeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I\n\nhad some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school;\n\nthere was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now\n\nall I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In\n\nretrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because\n\nthere were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying\n\nart in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been\n\noutnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the\n\nRISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed\n\nto pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay\n\nquestion by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the\n\nintellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited\n\nvocabulary.\n\n[2]I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.\n\nHere I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in\n\nthe hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again\n\nabout to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting\n\ndepartment at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,\n\nbut they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the\n\nstudents wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in\n\nreturn the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.\n\nAnd at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the\n\nconventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those\n\nlittle stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century\n\nstudio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible\n\nwithout getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides\n\nme. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally\n\ntrying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made\n\na living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a\n\nlocal antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a\n\nbook, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look\n\nold.\n\n[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still\n\nlives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because\n\nthe room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of\n\ncanvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still\n\nlives is different from painting people, because the subject, as\n\nits name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about\n\n15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still.\n\nSo the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint\n\na generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person\n\nyou're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy\n\npixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop\n\nthere, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what\n\nmakes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head.\n\nYou want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,\n\nthat the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is\n\nthat it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things\n\nyou can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not\n\njust in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic\n\nsense.\n\n[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was\n\nseeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're\n\nseeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes\n\nthat merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling\n\nyou details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or\n\n\"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every\n\nleaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it\n\nwould be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when\n\nyou have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and\n\nwhen you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new\n\nthings after days of trying to paint something people usually take\n\nfor granted, just as you can  after\n\ndays of trying to write an essay about something people usually\n\ntake for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a\n\ngood way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth\n\ntrying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked\n\nhard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of\n\npassport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me\n\nanything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the\n\nend of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very\n\nexpensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to\n\nRISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which\n\nmade software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?\n\nExactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat\n\nhigh end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.\n\n[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd\n\nadded a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a\n\ndialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in\n\nit. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I\n\nhereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad\n\nemployee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and\n\nsince I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood\n\nmost of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was\n\nback when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain\n\nworking hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the\n\nrest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at\n\nthe time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I\n\nspent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I\n\nhad by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially\n\nby art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the\n\nrent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was\n\ngetting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was\n\njust sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to\n\nsave enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly\n\nabout what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology\n\ncompanies to be run by product people than sales people (though\n\nsales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good\n\nat it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,\n\nthat cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that\n\nplanned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,\n\nbureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that\n\nthere's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the\n\noptimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal\n\nplace for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both\n\nViaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:\n\nthat it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that\n\nwill be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will\n\nbe, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means\n\nthat prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do\n\nfreelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and\n\nthis was how I survived for the next several years. When I came\n\nback to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new\n\nthing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of\n\nSGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at\n\nInterleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big\n\npart of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.\n\nThe foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had\n\nbeen a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art\n\nschool was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.\n\nBetter organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was\n\nnow becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship\n\nto art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the\n\npainting department. The textile department, which my next door\n\nneighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt\n\nillustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.\n\nPainting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the\n\nmore worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive\n\nsignature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business\n\nis known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the\n\nwork as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting\n\nthat looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy\n\nLichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in\n\nthe apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions\n\nof dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature\n\nstyle, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.\n\n[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\"\n\nin high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the\n\nbest art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They\n\ntended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,\n\nbut they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not\n\none of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was\n\ndefinitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style\n\nseekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I\n\nwas basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for\n\nfree. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,\n\nand then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A\n\nrent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New\n\nYork was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than\n\nmy current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists\n\nwere. So yes, I wanted it!\n\n[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul\n\nthat turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do\n\nsomething similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the\n\nUpper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least\n\nwasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home.\n\nNow I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of\n\nmaking paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was\n\non the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I\n\ndidn't want to have to program in another language, which in those\n\ndays would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose\n\nfor financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.\n\nThis would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used\n\nas a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties\n\nand spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of\n\nthis book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this\n\ntime.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and\n\nJulian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early\n\nphotorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've\n\nnever known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers\n\nof former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I\n\nmoved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.\n\nOne day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there\n\nwas something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't\n\nthat much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly\n\noccurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work\n\non whatever I want.Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called\n\nthe World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited\n\nhim in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It\n\nseemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical\n\nuser interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It\n\nseemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.\n\nI was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided\n\nwe should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't\n\nhonestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that\n\nthis was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art\n\ngalleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy\n\nones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate\n\nweb sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and\n\nset up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up\n\ngalleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.\n\nIt was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites\n\nfor them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that\n\nexcept for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd\n\nbeen generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called\n\nan \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy\n\nof ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write\n\nsoftware to build online stores. At first this was going to be\n\nnormal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.\n\nThat was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to\n\nwrite Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix\n\nworld. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store\n\nbuilder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new\n\nsite generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate\n\nwas away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his\n\nroom. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a\n\nmattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress\n\nI had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran\n\nthe software on the server, and let users control it by clicking\n\non links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users'\n\ncomputers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve\n\nthem from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at\n\nthe time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out,\n\nwe decided to try making a version of our store builder that you\n\ncould control through the browser. A couple days later, on August\n\n12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you\n\ncould build a whole store through the browser, without any client\n\nsoftware or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a\n\nwhole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't\n\nneed versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there\n\nhad been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to\n\nbe at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.\n\nNow you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our\n\nsoftware worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding\n\nfrom Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the\n\ninitial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%\n\nof the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y\n\nCombinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because\n\nwe'd needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand\n\ndollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by\n\nwhat I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside\n\nthe proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf?\n\nNo, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,\n\nI needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious\n\nabout the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to\n\nbuild a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating\n\npages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be\n\ngenerated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,\n\nthe links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the\n\nserver.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online\n\nstore builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking\n\nlegit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts\n\nand colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his\n\nbedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because\n\nit's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but\n\nin 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a\n\nmonth,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in\n\nretrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years\n\nlater. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,\n\nand I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.\n\nHe recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because\n\nat that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything\n\nin his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with\n\nhim. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a\n\nfrighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two\n\nmost independent-minded people\n\nI know, and in completely different\n\nways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a\n\ncolonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's\n\nit would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just\n\nas well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were\n\nlate, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of\n\ntalk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually\n\nwanted online stores.\n\n[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which\n\npeople used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,\n\nwhich Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and\n\nstatistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one\n\nof the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight\n\nand didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's\n\nand Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do\n\nwas work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the\n\neasiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of\n\nit stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were\n\ninstead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second\n\nhalf of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not\n\nthe Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It\n\nwas lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make\n\nViaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a\n\nmonth for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low\n\nprice was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of\n\ncompetitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we\n\nset the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.\n\n$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,\n\nwe did what's now called \"doing things that\n\ndon't scale,\" although\n\nat the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're\n\ndriven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common\n\nof which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly\n\nhumiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that\n\npeople could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get\n\nusers.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For\n\nexample, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt\n\n(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better\n\nto have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.\n\nThe reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to\n\nrescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were\n\nso beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.\n\nBuilding stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it\n\nfelt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled\n\nby \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in\n\ncharge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,\n\nin much the same way I was converted to\n\nfatherhood once I had kids.\n\nWhatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have\n\nso many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in\n\nthe meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn't get at the time is that\n\ngrowth rate is the\n\nultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about\n\n70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I\n\nmistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number\n\nof users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that\n\nthat's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough,\n\nyou might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate\n\ntakes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was\n\nadvising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed\n\nout, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't\n\nhire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then\n\nyou'll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted\n\nme to, and partly because that's what startups did during the\n\nInternet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would\n\nhave seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about\n\nwhen Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we\n\nwere at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.\n\nAnd since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the\n\nresult was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb\n\nstock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable\n\nand growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had\n\nno idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of\n\nthe near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor\n\nhad I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we\n\nstarted. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to\n\nriches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow\n\n1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were\n\nby far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must\n\nhave been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at\n\nthe time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running\n\nViaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue\n\nmy usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue\n\ncombined with Yahoo's prematurely aged\n\nculture and grim cube farm\n\nin Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it\n\nfelt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the\n\ntime I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth\n\nanything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next\n\nyear. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the\n\nsummer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything\n\nthat I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been\n\nentirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had\n\ndone this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now\n\nI was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation\n\nwith me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures\n\nI wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an\n\ninterest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.\n\nMy options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I\n\nwas leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to\n\ngo and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people\n\nwith me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was\n\nground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving\n\nthen to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,\n\nand yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.\n\nThere was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich.\n\nNow when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their\n\ncompanies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's\n\nwhat I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing\n\nfor a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or\n\nambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people\n\nin California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in\n\nthe Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from\n\nanywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation\n\nI went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent\n\ncontrol you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed\n\nup like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and\n\nthere were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't\n\nknow any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was\n\nrich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,\n\nexcept now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was\n\ntired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless\n\nit was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked\n\npast charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It\n\nwas exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented\n\nwith a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the\n\nold way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and\n\nthen use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted\n\nfrom the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually\n\nchoose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and\n\nvarious real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by\n\noccasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there\n\nwasn't one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear\n\nfrom our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why\n\nnot build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit\n\ncode on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting\n\napplications for them?\n\n[9]\n\nYou could run all sorts of services\n\non the servers that these applications could use just by making an\n\nAPI call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,\n\ntaking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything\n\nelse. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly\n\nwant to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would\n\nhave to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and\n\nstart it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but\n\nthere I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and\n\nthough he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into\n\nworking on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.\n\nSo while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly\n\nrefused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had\n\nworked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and\n\nwe got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty\n\ncompanies and several open source projects worth of software. The\n\nlanguage for defining applications would of course be a dialect of\n\nLisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt\n\nLisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan\n\ndid.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an\n\n\"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long\n\nbefore it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current\n\nfor long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going\n\nto be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network\n\ninfrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two\n\nservices (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the\n\nsummer I realized I really didn't want to run a company  especially\n\nnot a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd\n\nonly started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't\n\nneed money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be\n\nrealized as a company, then screw the vision. I'd build a subset\n\nthat could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not\n\nwasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often\n\nencounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and\n\nit was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and\n\neven trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,\n\nwhose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp\n\nhackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the\n\ndistinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and\n\npartly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of\n\nLisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So\n\nat the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new\n\ndialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a\n\ntalk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp\n\nat Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,\n\non paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but\n\nhad never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.\n\nWhat on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone\n\nhad posted it on Slashdot.\n\n[10]Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put\n\nit on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but\n\nit was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel\n\nto readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only\n\nway to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published\n\nas a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish\n\nanything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people\n\nhad realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building\n\nthe infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer\n\nas well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it\n\ntook me several years to understand the implications. It meant there\n\nwould be a whole new generation of\n\nessays.\n\n[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been\n\nvanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers\n\nwho went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed\n\nto publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.\n\nThere were so many essays that had never been written, because there\n\nhad been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going\n\nto write them.\n\n[12]I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there\n\nwas a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was\n\nwhen I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that\n\nwhatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a\n\nmarginal medium at first.\n\nSocially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their\n\nGeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions\n\npublished in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to\n\nfind that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how\n\nwell it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't\n\nprestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form\n\nof painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started\n\nthem. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what\n\nI'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish\n\non my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in\n\nsomething like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when\n\nyou find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current\n\nlack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to\n\nbe discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.\n\nImpure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is\n\ngoing to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.\n\nSo while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee\n\nyou're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the\n\nmost common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds\n\nof different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a\n\nbook, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I\n\nalso worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to\n\nhave dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which\n\ntaught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in\n\nCambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn\n\nstudio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was\n\na clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday\n\ndiners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one\n\nparty. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be\n\npeople they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests\n\nwas someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman\n\ncalled Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.\n\nThis bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,\n\nas she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised\n\nhow different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So\n\nshe decided to compile a book of\n\ninterviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her\n\nstaff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed\n\nfor a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make\n\nup their minds, and during this time I started telling her about\n\nall the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They\n\nshould make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a\n\nhandful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical\n\nfounders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as\n\nCEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.\n\nThe prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people\n\nand tell them something that won't waste their time is a great\n\nspur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the\n\nundergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would\n\ntell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the\n\nworst of the mistakes we'd made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the\n\nbest sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,\n\nbecause then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed\n\nthey were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect\n\nof having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known),\n\nI blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward\n\nit occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about\n\nangel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now\n\nit was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects\n\nwe could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed\n\nlike there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the\n\ncorner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.\n\nScrew the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd\n\nstart our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd\n\nbeen talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and\n\nwork for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too.\n\n[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to\n\nbe angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways\n\nto learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,\n\nand some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure\n\nthem all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.\n\nIn those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC\n\nfirms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was\n\nto make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.\n\nAnd there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were\n\nindividuals who were usually focused on other things and made\n\ninvestments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough\n\nin the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,\n\nbecause we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing\n\nJulian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us\n\nset up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,\n\nbut actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all\n\nthat stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to\n\nmake seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had\n\ndone for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we\n\nfunded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,\n\nbut professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got\n\nall the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular\n\ninsight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized.\n\nIt never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we\n\nwouldn't have known where to start.\n\n[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a\n\nbunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three\n\nmonths focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we\n\ndiscovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due\n\nto our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as\n\ninvestors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch\n\nof startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech\n\ncompanies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where\n\nthey'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being\n\nin a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense\n\nbe fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out\n\nof it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and\n\nthey for their part would probably have a more interesting summer\n\nthan they would working at Microsoft.We'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.\n\nWe'd all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was\n\nalready cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after\n\ndinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a\n\nmatter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders\n\nProgram, and I posted an\n\nannouncement\n\non my site, inviting undergrads\n\nto apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way\n\nto get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be\n\nthe perfect source.\n\n[15]\n\nWe got 225 applications for the Summer\n\nFounders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them\n\nwere from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that\n\nspring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious\n\nthan we'd intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and\n\nfrom those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That\n\nfirst batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went\n\non to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the\n\nRSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,\n\nand Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.\n\nI don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.\n\nYou had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the\n\nSummer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place\n\nlike Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did\n\nwith Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students\n\ngot for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the\n\ntypical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to\n\nbe fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had\n\ntaken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought\n\nthe founders free air conditioners.\n\n[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale\n\nstartup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient\n\nfor us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups\n\nat once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.\n\nIt solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the\n\nisolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who\n\nunderstood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they\n\nwere solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The\n\nalumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,\n\nand especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being\n\nin. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's\n\ncustomers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC\n\ngrows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups\n\nget their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their\n\nbatchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going\n\nto do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,\n\nand I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more\n\nthan a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was\n\nstill able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version\n\nof Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into\n\nScheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was\n\noriginally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and\n\nwas called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of\n\nreading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders\n\nwe wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed\n\nthe name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's\n\nintellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest\n\nsource of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help\n\nfounders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN\n\nwas a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work\n\nshould at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas\n\nI was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not\n\nfrom the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an\n\nill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during\n\nYC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%\n\nchance it had do with everything else combined.\n\n[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But\n\nwhile I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped\n\nworking on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly\n\nbecause it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language\n\nnow that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my\n\nthree projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on\n\nYC.YC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of\n\ndeciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every\n\n6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,\n\nwhatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,\n\nbecause their problems were quite varied, and the good founders\n\nwere very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could\n\nabout startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have\n\npicked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders,\n\nfiguring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who\n\nmaltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the\n\nparts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once\n\nsaid about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant\n\nit both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second\n\npart that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked\n\nset the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better\n\nwork very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,\n\nRobert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited\n\nadvice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at\n\nViaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested\n\nthat it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.\n\nThat was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I\n\nremember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you\n\nshould make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"At the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it\n\ndawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange\n\nadvice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer\n\nthan Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me\n\nthinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be\n\nthe last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my\n\nattention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of\n\neating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave\n\neventually. And it wasn't, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned\n\nout to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed\n\nher balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really\n\nwanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I\n\nwere determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to\n\nvisit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those\n\nflights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to\n\nsomeone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so\n\nwe decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and\n\nTrevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.\n\nUp till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we\n\nfour had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to\n\ndo that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said\n\nyes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and\n\nJessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he\n\nsaid no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.\n\nBut I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided\n\nhe'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest\n\nof 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could\n\nlearn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose\n\ncancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was\n\nstill hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups\n\nthrough Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still\n\ntalk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested\n\nin, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about\n\nthat. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided\n\nI'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused\n\non it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.\n\nI was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was\n\nat least completely engaging.\n\n[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to\n\nwork so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had\n\nbeen. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the\n\nmiddle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd\n\nalways been curious to see how the painting I was working on would\n\nturn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So\n\nI stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted\n\nsince. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum\n\ngame. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project\n\nthat's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's\n\ngetting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was\n\nsome opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over\n\nthe next few months. I even wrote a couple that\n\nweren't about\n\nstartups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language\n\ndefined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn't originally\n\nintended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was\n\nmeant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the\n\nTuring machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language\n\nin itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need?\n\nThe Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,\n\nis an answer to that question.\n\n[19]McCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program\n\ncomputers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell\n\ntranslated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,\n\nand from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language\n\nin the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation\n\ngave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match.\n\nIt was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand\n\nwhy at the time.McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.\n\nIt was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language.\n\nSo these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined\n\nusing McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have\n\nbeen feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by\n\nhand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting\n\nclose to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,\n\nthere was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more\n\ncomplicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers\n\nthen weren't powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's\n\naxiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language.\n\nAnd as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a\n\ndiscoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,\n\nend up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to\n\ndo than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,\n\nwhy not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,\n\nfrom March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I\n\nhad a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep\n\nat it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel,\n\nin itself in Arc. That may sound\n\nlike a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery\n\nI had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious\n\ncollection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an\n\ninterpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,\n\nbut fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,\n\nor I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing\n\nessays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely\n\nunderstand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as\n\nbecause the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an\n\ninterpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's\n\nhappening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted\n\nby the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people\n\nabout Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have\n\nseemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder\n\nthan I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for\n\nhours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone\n\nasking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively\n\nthat at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head\n\nand could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the\n\ncoast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some\n\nproblem involving continuations while I watched them play in the\n\ntide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that\n\nbecause I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news\n\nis that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to\n\nsee what it was like living in another country, and since I was a\n\nBritish citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only\n\nmeant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still\n\nlive there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy's\n\noriginal Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although\n\nlike McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics\n\nI'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also\n\nstarted to think about other things I could work on. How should I\n\nchoose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the\n\npast? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I\n\nwas surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If\n\nthis surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would\n\nbe interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with\n\nsimilarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others\n\nto read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\nNotes[1]\n\nMy experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:\n\ntime-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from\n\nbatch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem\n\nall the more exciting.[2]\n\nItalian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be\n\npredicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps\n\nlike polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you\n\nstring together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,\n\nyou can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]\n\nI lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia\n\nwent straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across\n\nthe bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,\n\nand then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at\n\nstreet level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter\n\nevenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with\n\ntourists.[4]\n\nYou can of course paint people like still lives if you want\n\nto, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex\n\nof still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce\n\npained expressions in the sitters.[5]\n\nInterleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and\n\nbuilt impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law.\n\nIn the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.\n\nIntel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and\n\nsoftware companies like a bulldozer.[6]\n\nThe signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically\n\nmercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.\n\nAnything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as\n\ncool will soon become equally expensive.[7]\n\nTechnically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but\n\nrent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would\n\nknow or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less\n\nthan half market price.[8]\n\nMost software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when\n\nthe software is an online store builder and you're hosting the\n\nstores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully\n\nobvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch\n\nprivately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and\n\nmaking sure they had decent-looking stores.[9]\n\nWe'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their\n\nown page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp\n\nexpressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the\n\ncode ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers\n\nvisited them.[10]\n\nThis was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,\n\nand so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found\n\nthey were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was\n\nbetter than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete?\n\nPeople who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me\n\nhow sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply\n\nthat it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It\n\ncomes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they\n\ndon't already know, and some\n\npeople dislike being told such things.[11]\n\nPeople put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of\n\ncourse, but putting something online is not the same as publishing\n\nit online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as\n\nthe (or at least a) primary version.[12]\n\nThere is a general lesson here that our experience with Y\n\nCombinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long\n\nafter the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary\n\nVC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,\n\nbeen based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more\n\nexpensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap\n\nand common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world,\n\njust as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints\n\nof the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.\n\nless influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected\n\nby rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which\n\nfields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and\n\nventure capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay\n\nwriting would be?[13]\n\nY Combinator was not the original name. At first we were\n\ncalled Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case\n\nsomeone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after\n\none of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and\n\npartly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors\n\nlike maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying\n\nto appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside\n\njoke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made\n\nthe YC logo a white Y on an orange square.[14]\n\nYC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,\n\nbecause it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it\n\npersonally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go\n\nback to being self-funded.[15]\n\nI've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies\n\nthat the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This\n\nis not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by\n\ncausing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16]\n\nShe reports that they were all different shapes and sizes,\n\nbecause there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get\n\nwhatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could\n\ncarry now.[17]\n\nAnother problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs\n\nwhen you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,\n\nyou're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every\n\nconversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post\n\nhighly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually\n\nthese two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination\n\nis disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations,\n\nbecause the assumption that you're present in the conversation means\n\nthat not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation\n\nreads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn\n\nencourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses\n\nthat now is their chance.[18]\n\nThe worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica\n\nanymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known\n\neach other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from\n\nour personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted\n\ntree.[19]\n\nOne way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs\n\ndiscovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced\n\nalien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean\n\ntheorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that\n\nthey would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.But if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of\n\nthe language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need\n\nnumbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at\n\nleast one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness\n\nis preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel\n\nGackle, Ralph Hazell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj\n\nTaggar for reading drafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 13642, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:40.269969Z"}
{"id": "earnest", "title": "Earnestness", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/earnest.html", "date": null, "content": "December 2020Jessica and I have certain words that have special significance\n\nwhen we're talking about startups. The highest compliment we can\n\npay to founders is to describe them as \"earnest.\" This is not by\n\nitself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable.\n\nBut when founders are both formidable (another of our words) and\n\nearnest, they're as close to unstoppable as you get.Earnestness sounds like a boring, even Victorian virtue. It seems\n\na bit of an anachronism that people in Silicon Valley would care\n\nabout it. Why does this matter so much?When you call someone earnest, you're making a statement about their\n\nmotives. It means both that they're doing something for the right\n\nreasons, and that they're trying as hard as they can. If we imagine\n\nmotives as vectors, it means both the direction and the magnitude\n\nare right. Though these are of course related: when people are doing\n\nsomething for the right reasons, they try harder.\n\n[1]The reason motives matter so much in Silicon Valley is that so many\n\npeople there have the wrong ones. Starting a successful startup\n\nmakes you rich and famous. So a lot of the people trying to start\n\nthem are doing it for those reasons. Instead of what? Instead of\n\ninterest in the problem for its own sake. That is the root of\n\nearnestness.\n\n[2]It's also the hallmark of a nerd. Indeed, when people describe\n\nthemselves as \"x nerds,\" what they mean is that they're interested\n\nin x for its own sake, and not because it's cool to be interested\n\nin x, or because of what they can get from it. They're saying they\n\ncare so much about x that they're willing to sacrifice seeming cool\n\nfor its sake.A genuine interest\n\nin something is a very powerful motivator  for\n\nsome people, the most powerful motivator of all.\n\n[3]\n\nWhich is why\n\nit's what Jessica and I look for in founders. But as well as being\n\na source of strength, it's also a source of vulnerability. Caring\n\nconstrains you. The earnest can't easily reply in kind to mocking\n\nbanter, or put on a cool facade of nihil admirari. They care too\n\nmuch. They are doomed to be the straight man. That's a real\n\ndisadvantage in your\n\nteenage years,\n\nwhen mocking banter and nihil\n\nadmirari often have the upper hand. But it becomes an advantage\n\nlater.It's a commonplace now that the kids who were\n\nnerds in high school\n\nbecome the cool kids' bosses later on. But people misunderstand why\n\nthis happens. It's not just because the nerds are smarter, but also\n\nbecause they're more earnest. When the problems get harder than the\n\nfake ones you're given in high school, caring about them starts to\n\nmatter.Does it always matter? Do the earnest always win? Not always. It\n\nprobably doesn't matter much in politics, or in crime, or in certain\n\ntypes of business that are similar to crime, like gambling, personal\n\ninjury law, patent trolling, and so on. Nor does it matter in\n\nacademic fields at the more\n\nbogus end of the spectrum. And though\n\nI don't know enough to say for sure, it may not matter in some kinds\n\nof humor: it may be possible to be completely cynical and still be\n\nvery funny.\n\n[4]Looking at the list of fields I mentioned, there's an obvious\n\npattern. Except possibly for humor, these are all types of work I'd\n\navoid like the plague. So that could be a useful heuristic for\n\ndeciding which fields to work in: how much does earnestness matter?\n\nWhich can in turn presumably be inferred from the prevalence of\n\nnerds at the top.Along with \"nerd,\" another word that tends to be associated with\n\nearnestness is \"naive.\" The earnest often seem naive.  It's not\n\njust that they don't have the motives other people have. They often\n\ndon't fully grasp that such motives exist. Or they may know\n\nintellectually that they do, but because they don't feel them, they\n\nforget about them.\n\n[5]It works to be slightly naive not just about motives but also,\n\nbelieve it or not, about the problems you're working on. Naive\n\noptimism can compensate for the bit rot that\n\nrapid change causes\n\nin established beliefs. You plunge into some problem saying \"How\n\nhard can it be?\", and then after solving it you learn that it was\n\ntill recently insoluble.Naivete is an obstacle for anyone who wants to seem sophisticated,\n\nand this is one reason would-be intellectuals find it so difficult\n\nto understand Silicon Valley. It hasn't been safe for such people\n\nto use the word \"earnest\" outside scare quotes since Oscar Wilde\n\nwrote \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" in 1895. And yet when you\n\nzoom in on Silicon Valley, right into\n\nJessica Livingston's brain,\n\nthat's what her x-ray vision\n\nis seeking out in founders. Earnestness!\n\nWho'd have guessed? Reporters literally can't believe it when\n\nfounders making piles of money say that they started their companies\n\nto make the world better. The situation seems made for mockery.\n\nHow can these founders be so naive as not to realize how implausible\n\nthey sound?Though those asking this question don't realize it, that's not a\n\nrhetorical question.A lot of founders are faking it, of course, particularly the smaller\n\nfry, and the soon to be smaller fry. But not all of them. There are\n\na significant number of founders who really are interested in the\n\nproblem they're solving mainly for its own sake.Why shouldn't there be? We have no difficulty believing that people\n\nwould be interested in history or math or even old bus tickets for\n\ntheir own sake. Why can't there be people interested in self-driving\n\ncars or social networks for their own sake? When you look at the\n\nquestion from this side, it seems obvious there would be. And isn't\n\nit likely that having a deep interest in something would be a source\n\nof great energy and resilience? It is in every other field.The question really is why we have a blind spot about business.\n\nAnd the answer to that is obvious if you know enough history. For\n\nmost of history, making large amounts of money has not been very\n\nintellectually interesting. In preindustrial times it was never far\n\nfrom robbery, and some areas of business still retain that character,\n\nexcept using lawyers instead of soldiers.But there are other areas of business where the work is genuinely\n\ninteresting. Henry Ford got to spend much of his time working on\n\ninteresting technical problems, and for the last several decades\n\nthe trend in that direction has been accelerating. It's much easier\n\nnow to make a lot of money by working on something you're interested\n\nin than it was 50 years ago.\n\nAnd that, rather than how fast they\n\ngrow, may be the most important change that startups represent.\n\nThough indeed, the fact that the work is genuinely interesting is\n\na big part of why it gets done so fast.\n\n[6]Can you imagine a more important change than one in the relationship\n\nbetween intellectual curiosity and money? These are two of the most\n\npowerful forces in the world, and in my lifetime they've become\n\nsignificantly more aligned. How could you not be fascinated to watch\n\nsomething like this happening in real time?I meant this essay to be about earnestness generally, and now I've\n\ngone and talked about startups again. But I suppose at least it\n\nserves as an example of an x nerd in the wild.Notes[1]\n\nIt's interesting how many different ways there are not to\n\nbe earnest: to be cleverly cynical, to be superficially brilliant,\n\nto be conspicuously virtuous, to be cool, to be sophisticated, to\n\nbe orthodox, to be a snob, to bully, to pander, to be on the make.\n\nThis pattern suggests that earnestness is not one end of a continuum,\n\nbut a target one can fall short of in multiple dimensions.Another thing I notice about this list is that it sounds like a\n\nlist of the ways people behave on Twitter. Whatever else social\n\nmedia is, it's a vivid catalogue of ways not to be earnest.[2]\n\nPeople's motives are as mixed in Silicon Valley as anywhere\n\nelse. Even the founders motivated mostly by money tend to be at\n\nleast somewhat interested in the problem they're solving, and even\n\nthe founders most interested in the problem they're solving also\n\nlike the idea of getting rich. But there's great variation in the\n\nrelative proportions of different founders' motivations.And when I talk about \"wrong\" motives, I don't mean morally wrong.\n\nThere's nothing morally wrong with starting a startup to make money.\n\nI just mean that those startups don't do as well.[3]\n\nThe most powerful motivator for most people is probably family.\n\nBut there are some for whom intellectual curiosity comes first. In\n\nhis (wonderful) autobiography, Paul Halmos says explicitly that for\n\na mathematician, math must come before anything else, including\n\nfamily. Which at least implies that it did for him.[4]\n\nInterestingly, just as the word \"nerd\" implies earnestness even\n\nwhen used as a metaphor, the word \"politics\" implies the opposite.\n\nIt's not only in actual politics that earnestness seems to be a\n\nhandicap, but also in office politics and academic politics.[5]\n\nIt's a bigger social error to seem naive in most European\n\ncountries than it is in America, and this may be one of subtler\n\nreasons startups are less common there. Founder culture is completely\n\nat odds with sophisticated cynicism.The most earnest part of Europe is Scandinavia, and not surprisingly\n\nthis is also the region with the highest number of successful\n\nstartups per capita.[6]\n\nMuch of business is schleps, and probably always will be. But\n\neven being a professor is largely schleps. It would be interesting\n\nto collect statistics about the schlep ratios of different jobs,\n\nbut I suspect they'd rarely be less than 30%.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Suhail Doshi, Jessica\n\nLivingston, Mattias Ljungman, Harj Taggar, and Kyle Vogt for reading\n\ndrafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1641, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:40.861369Z"}
{"id": "ace", "title": "Billionaires Build", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/ace.html", "date": null, "content": "December 2020As I was deciding what to write about next, I was surprised to find\n\nthat two separate essays I'd been planning to write were actually\n\nthe same.The first is about how to ace your Y Combinator interview. There\n\nhas been so much nonsense written about this topic that I've been\n\nmeaning for years to write something telling founders the truth.The second is about something politicians sometimes say  that the\n\nonly way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people  and why\n\nthis is mistaken.Keep reading, and you'll learn both simultaneously.I know the politicians are mistaken because it was my job to predict\n\nwhich people will become billionaires. I think I can truthfully say\n\nthat I know as much about how to do this as anyone. If the key to\n\nbecoming a billionaire  the defining feature of billionaires \n\nwas to exploit people, then I, as a professional billionaire scout,\n\nwould surely realize this and look for people who would be good at\n\nit, just as an NFL scout looks for speed in wide receivers.But aptitude for exploiting people is not what Y Combinator looks\n\nfor at all. In fact, it's the opposite of what they look for. I'll\n\ntell you what they do look for, by explaining how to convince\n\nY Combinator to fund you, and you can see for yourself.What YC looks for, above all, is founders who understand some group\n\nof users and can make what they want. This is so important that\n\nit's YC's motto: \"Make something people want.\"A big company can to some extent force unsuitable products on\n\nunwilling customers, but a startup doesn't have the power to do\n\nthat. A startup must sing for its supper, by making things that\n\ngenuinely delight its customers. Otherwise it will never get off\n\nthe ground.Here's where things get difficult, both for you as a founder and\n\nfor the YC partners trying to decide whether to fund you. In a\n\nmarket economy, it's hard to make something people want that they\n\ndon't already have. That's the great thing about market economies.\n\nIf other people both knew about this need and were able to satisfy\n\nit, they already would be, and there would be no room for your\n\nstartup.Which means the conversation during your YC interview will have to\n\nbe about something new: either a new need, or a new way to satisfy\n\none. And not just new, but uncertain. If it were certain that the\n\nneed existed and that you could satisfy it, that certainty would\n\nbe reflected in large and rapidly growing revenues, and you wouldn't\n\nbe seeking seed funding.So the YC partners have to guess both whether you've discovered a\n\nreal need, and whether you'll be able to satisfy it. That's what they\n\nare, at least in this part of their job: professional guessers.\n\nThey have 1001 heuristics for doing this, and I'm not going to tell\n\nyou all of them, but I'm happy to tell you the most important ones,\n\nbecause these can't be faked; the only way to \"hack\" them would be\n\nto do what you should be doing anyway as a founder.The first thing the partners will try to figure out, usually, is\n\nwhether what you're making will ever be something a lot of people\n\nwant. It doesn't have to be something a lot of people want now.\n\nThe product and the market will both evolve, and will influence\n\neach other's evolution. But in the end there has to be something\n\nwith a huge market. That's what the partners will be trying to\n\nfigure out: is there a path to a huge market?\n\n[1]Sometimes it's obvious there will be a huge market. If\n\nBoom manages\n\nto ship an airliner at all, international airlines will have to buy\n\nit. But usually it's not obvious. Usually the path to a huge market\n\nis by growing a small market. This idea is important enough that\n\nit's worth coining a phrase for, so let's call one of these small\n\nbut growable markets a \"larval market.\"The perfect example of a larval market might be Apple's market when\n\nthey were founded in 1976. In 1976, not many people wanted their\n\nown computer. But more and more started to want one, till now every\n\n10 year old on the planet wants a computer (but calls it a \"phone\").The ideal combination is the group of founders who are\n\n\"living in\n\nthe future\" in the sense of being at the leading edge of some kind\n\nof change, and who are building something they themselves want.\n\nMost super-successful startups are of this type. Steve Wozniak\n\nwanted a computer. Mark Zuckerberg wanted to engage online with his\n\ncollege friends. Larry and Sergey wanted to find things on the web.\n\nAll these founders were building things they and their peers wanted,\n\nand the fact that they were at the leading edge of change meant\n\nthat more people would want these things in the future.But although the ideal larval market is oneself and one's peers,\n\nthat's not the only kind. A larval market might also be regional,\n\nfor example. You build something to serve one location, and then\n\nexpand to others.The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist. That\n\nmay seem like an obvious point, but the lack of it is the biggest\n\nflaw in most startup ideas. There have to be some people who want\n\nwhat you're building right now, and want it so urgently that they're\n\nwilling to use it, bugs and all, even though you're a small company\n\nthey've never heard of. There don't have to be many, but there have\n\nto be some. As long as you have some users, there are straightforward\n\nways to get more: build new features they want, seek out more people\n\nlike them, get them to refer you to their friends, and so on. But\n\nthese techniques all require some initial seed group of users.So this is one thing the YC partners will almost certainly dig into\n\nduring your interview. Who are your first users going to be, and\n\nhow do you know they want this? If I had to decide whether to fund\n\nstartups based on a single question, it would be \"How do you know\n\npeople want this?\"The most convincing answer is \"Because we and our friends want it.\"\n\nIt's even better when this is followed by the news that you've\n\nalready built a prototype, and even though it's very crude, your\n\nfriends are using it, and it's spreading by word of mouth. If you\n\ncan say that and you're not lying, the partners will switch from\n\ndefault no to default yes. Meaning you're in unless there's some\n\nother disqualifying flaw.That is a hard standard to meet, though. Airbnb didn't meet it.\n\nThey had the first part. They had made something they themselves\n\nwanted. But it wasn't spreading. So don't feel bad if you don't hit\n\nthis gold standard of convincingness. If Airbnb didn't hit it, it\n\nmust be too high.In practice, the YC partners will be satisfied if they feel that\n\nyou have a deep understanding of your users' needs. And the Airbnbs\n\ndid have that. They were able to tell us all about what motivated\n\nhosts and guests. They knew from first-hand experience, because\n\nthey'd been the first hosts. We couldn't ask them a question they\n\ndidn't know the answer to. We ourselves were not very excited about\n\nthe idea as users, but we knew this didn't prove anything, because\n\nthere were lots of successful startups we hadn't been excited about\n\nas users. We were able to say to ourselves \"They seem to know what\n\nthey're talking about. Maybe they're onto something. It's not growing\n\nyet, but maybe they can figure out how to make it grow during YC.\"\n\nWhich they did, about three weeks into the batch.The best thing you can do in a YC interview is to teach the partners\n\nabout your users. So if you want to prepare for your interview, one of the best\n\nways to do it is to go talk to your users and find out exactly what\n\nthey're thinking. Which is what you should be doing anyway.This may sound strangely credulous, but the YC partners want to\n\nrely on the founders to tell them about the market. Think about\n\nhow VCs typically judge the potential market for an idea. They're\n\nnot ordinarily domain experts themselves, so they forward the idea\n\nto someone who is, and ask for their opinion. YC doesn't have time\n\nto do this, but if the YC partners can convince themselves that the\n\nfounders both (a) know what they're talking about and (b) aren't\n\nlying, they don't need outside domain experts. They can use the\n\nfounders themselves as domain experts when evaluating their own\n\nidea.This is why YC interviews aren't pitches. To give as many founders\n\nas possible a chance to get funded, we made interviews as short as\n\nwe could: 10 minutes. That is not enough time for the partners to\n\nfigure out, through the indirect evidence in a pitch, whether you\n\nknow what you're talking about and aren't lying. They need to dig\n\nin and ask you questions. There's not enough time for sequential\n\naccess. They need random access.\n\n[2]The worst advice I ever heard about how to succeed in a YC interview\n\nis that you should take control of the interview and make sure to\n\ndeliver the message you want to. In other words, turn the interview\n\ninto a pitch. ⟨elaborate expletive⟩. It is so annoying when people\n\ntry to do that. You ask them a question, and instead of answering\n\nit, they deliver some obviously prefabricated blob of pitch. It\n\neats up 10 minutes really fast.There is no one who can give you accurate advice about what to do\n\nin a YC interview except a current or former YC partner. People\n\nwho've merely been interviewed, even successfully, have no idea of\n\nthis, but interviews take all sorts of different forms depending\n\non what the partners want to know about most. Sometimes they're all\n\nabout the founders, other times they're all about the idea. Sometimes\n\nsome very narrow aspect of the idea. Founders sometimes walk away\n\nfrom interviews complaining that they didn't get to explain their\n\nidea completely. True, but they explained enough.Since a YC interview consists of questions, the way to do it well\n\nis to answer them well. Part of that is answering them candidly.\n\nThe partners don't expect you to know everything. But if you don't\n\nknow the answer to a question, don't try to bullshit your way out\n\nof it. The partners, like most experienced investors, are professional\n\nbullshit detectors, and you are (hopefully) an amateur bullshitter.\n\nAnd if you try to bullshit them and fail, they may not even tell\n\nyou that you failed. So it's better to be honest than to try to\n\nsell them. If you don't know the answer to a question, say you\n\ndon't, and tell them how you'd go about finding it, or tell them\n\nthe answer to some related question.If you're asked, for example, what could go wrong, the worst possible\n\nanswer is \"nothing.\" Instead of convincing them that your idea is\n\nbullet-proof, this will convince them that you're a fool or a liar.\n\nFar better to go into gruesome detail. That's what experts do when\n\nyou ask what could go wrong.  The partners know that your idea is\n\nrisky. That's what a good bet looks like at this stage: a tiny\n\nprobability of a huge outcome.Ditto if they ask about competitors. Competitors are rarely what\n\nkills startups. Poor execution does. But you should know who your\n\ncompetitors are, and tell the YC partners candidly what your relative\n\nstrengths and weaknesses are. Because the YC partners know that\n\ncompetitors don't kill startups, they won't hold competitors against\n\nyou too much. They will, however, hold it against you if you seem\n\neither to be unaware of competitors, or to be minimizing the threat\n\nthey pose. They may not be sure whether you're clueless or lying,\n\nbut they don't need to be.The partners don't expect your idea to be perfect. This is seed\n\ninvesting. At this stage, all they can expect are promising hypotheses.\n\nBut they do expect you to be thoughtful and honest. So if trying\n\nto make your idea seem perfect causes you to come off as glib or\n\nclueless, you've sacrificed something you needed for something you\n\ndidn't.If the partners are sufficiently convinced that there's a path to\n\na big market, the next question is whether you'll be able to find\n\nit. That in turn depends on three things: the general qualities of\n\nthe founders, their specific expertise in this domain, and the\n\nrelationship between them. How determined are the founders? Are\n\nthey good at building things? Are they resilient enough to keep\n\ngoing when things go wrong? How strong is their friendship?Though the Airbnbs only did ok in the idea department, they did\n\nspectacularly well in this department. The story of how they'd\n\nfunded themselves by making Obama- and McCain-themed breakfast\n\ncereal was the single most important factor in our decision to fund\n\nthem. They didn't realize it at the time, but what seemed to them\n\nan irrelevant story was in fact fabulously good evidence of their\n\nqualities as founders. It showed they were resourceful and determined,\n\nand could work together.It wasn't just the cereal story that showed that, though. The whole\n\ninterview showed that they cared. They weren't doing this just for\n\nthe money, or because startups were cool. The reason they were\n\nworking so hard on this company was because it was their project.\n\nThey had discovered an interesting new idea, and they just couldn't\n\nlet it go.Mundane as it sounds, that's the most powerful motivator of all,\n\nnot just in startups, but in most ambitious undertakings: to be\n\ngenuinely interested in what\n\nyou're building. This is what really\n\ndrives billionaires, or at least the ones who become billionaires\n\nfrom starting companies. The company is their project.One thing few people realize about billionaires is that all of them\n\ncould have stopped sooner. They could have gotten acquired, or found\n\nsomeone else to run the company. Many founders do. The ones who\n\nbecome really rich are the ones who keep working. And what makes\n\nthem keep working is not just money. What keeps them working is the\n\nsame thing that keeps anyone else working when they could stop if\n\nthey wanted to: that there's nothing else they'd rather do.That, not exploiting people, is the defining quality of people who\n\nbecome billionaires from starting companies. So that's what YC looks\n\nfor in founders: authenticity. People's motives for starting startups\n\nare usually mixed. They're usually doing it from some combination\n\nof the desire to make money, the desire to seem cool, genuine\n\ninterest in the problem, and unwillingness to work for someone else.\n\nThe last two are more powerful motivators than the first two. It's\n\nok for founders to want to make money or to seem cool. Most do.\n\nBut if the founders seem like they're doing it just to make money\n\nor just to seem cool, they're not likely to succeed on a big\n\nscale. The founders who are doing it for the money will take the\n\nfirst sufficiently large acquisition offer, and the ones who are\n\ndoing it to seem cool will rapidly discover that there are much\n\nless painful ways of seeming cool.\n\n[3]Y Combinator certainly sees founders whose m.o. is to exploit people.\n\nYC is a magnet for them, because they want the YC brand. But when\n\nthe YC partners detect someone like that, they reject them. If bad\n\npeople made good founders, the YC partners would face a moral\n\ndilemma. Fortunately they don't, because bad people make bad founders.\n\nThis exploitative type of founder is not going to succeed on a large\n\nscale, and in fact probably won't even succeed on a small one,\n\nbecause they're always going to be taking shortcuts. They see YC\n\nitself as a shortcut.Their exploitation usually begins with their own cofounders, which\n\nis disastrous, since the cofounders' relationship is the foundation\n\nof the company. Then it moves on to the users, which is also\n\ndisastrous, because the sort of early adopters a successful startup\n\nwants as its initial users are the hardest to fool. The best this\n\nkind of founder can hope for is to keep the edifice of deception\n\ntottering along until some acquirer can be tricked into buying it.\n\nBut that kind of acquisition is never very big.\n\n[4]If professional billionaire scouts know that exploiting people is\n\nnot the skill to look for, why do some politicians think this is\n\nthe defining quality of billionaires?I think they start from the feeling that it's wrong that one person\n\ncould have so much more money than another. It's understandable\n\nwhere that feeling comes from. It's in our DNA, and even in the DNA\n\nof other species.If they limited themselves to saying that it made them feel bad\n\nwhen one person had so much more money than other people, who would\n\ndisagree? It makes me feel bad too, and I think people who make a\n\nlot of money have a moral obligation to use it for the common good.\n\nThe mistake they make is to jump from feeling bad that some people\n\nare much richer than others to the conclusion that there's no\n\nlegitimate way to make a very large amount of money. Now we're\n\ngetting into statements that are not only falsifiable, but false.There are certainly some people who become rich by doing bad things.\n\nBut there are also plenty of people who behave badly and don't make\n\nthat much from it. There is no correlation  in fact, probably an\n\ninverse correlation  between how badly you behave and how much\n\nmoney you make.The greatest danger of this nonsense may not even be that it sends\n\npolicy astray, but that it misleads ambitious people. Can you imagine\n\na better way to destroy social mobility than by telling poor kids\n\nthat the way to get rich is by exploiting people, while the rich\n\nkids know, from having watched the preceding generation do it, how\n\nit's really done?I'll tell you how it's really done, so you can at least tell your\n\nown kids the truth. It's all about users. The most reliable way to\n\nbecome a billionaire is to start a company that\n\ngrows fast, and the\n\nway to grow fast is to make what users want. Newly started startups\n\nhave no choice but to delight users, or they'll never even get\n\nrolling. But this never stops being the lodestar, and bigger companies\n\ntake their eye off it at their peril. Stop delighting users, and\n\neventually someone else will.Users are what the partners want to\n\nknow about in YC interviews, and what I want to know about when I\n\ntalk to founders that we funded ten years ago and who are billionaires\n\nnow. What do users want? What new things could you build for them?\n\nFounders who've become billionaires are always eager to talk about\n\nthat topic. That's how they became billionaires.Notes[1]\n\nThe YC partners have so much practice doing this that they\n\nsometimes see paths that the founders themselves haven't seen yet.\n\nThe partners don't try to seem skeptical, as buyers in transactions\n\noften do to increase their leverage. Although the founders feel\n\ntheir job is to convince the partners of the potential of their\n\nidea, these roles are not infrequently reversed, and the founders\n\nleave the interview feeling their idea has more potential than they\n\nrealized.[2]\n\nIn practice, 7 minutes would be enough. You rarely change your\n\nmind at minute 8. But 10 minutes is socially convenient.[3]\n\nI myself took the first sufficiently large acquisition offer\n\nin my first startup, so I don't blame founders for doing this.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with starting a startup to make money. You\n\nneed to make money somehow, and for some people startups are the\n\nmost efficient way to do it. I'm just saying that these are not the\n\nstartups that get really big.[4]\n\nNot these days, anyway. There were some big ones during the\n\nInternet Bubble, and indeed some big IPOs.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Geoff Ralston, and\n\nHarj Taggar for reading drafts of this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 3374, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:41.467843Z"}
{"id": "airbnbs", "title": "The Airbnbs", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/airbnbs.html", "date": null, "content": "December 2020To celebrate Airbnb's IPO and to help future founders, I thought\n\nit might be useful to explain what was special about Airbnb.What was special about the Airbnbs was how earnest they were. They\n\ndid nothing half-way, and we could sense this even in the interview.\n\nSometimes after we interviewed a startup we'd be uncertain what to\n\ndo, and have to talk it over. Other times we'd just look at one\n\nanother and smile. The Airbnbs' interview was that kind. We didn't\n\neven like the idea that much. Nor did users, at that stage; they\n\nhad no growth. But the founders seemed so full of energy that it\n\nwas impossible not to like them.That first impression was not misleading. During the batch our\n\nnickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil, because like the\n\ncartoon\n\ncharacter he seemed a tornado of energy. All three of them were\n\nlike that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the Airbnbs\n\ndid. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If you suggested\n\nan idea to them in office hours, the next time you talked to them\n\nthey'd not only have implemented it, but also implemented two new\n\nideas they had in the process. \"They probably have the best attitude\n\nof any startup we've funded\" I wrote to Mike Arrington during the\n\nbatch.They're still like that. Jessica and I had dinner with Brian in the\n\nsummer of 2018, just the three of us. By this point the company is\n\nten years old. He took a page of notes about ideas for new things\n\nAirbnb could do.What we didn't realize when we first met Brian and Joe and Nate was\n\nthat Airbnb was on its last legs. After working on the company for\n\na year and getting no growth, they'd agreed to give it one last\n\nshot. They'd try this Y Combinator thing, and if the company still\n\ndidn't take off, they'd give up.Any normal person would have given up already. They'd been funding\n\nthe company with credit cards. They had a binder full of\n\ncredit cards they'd maxed out. Investors didn't think much of the\n\nidea. One investor they met in a cafe walked out in the middle of\n\nmeeting with them. They thought he was going to the bathroom, but\n\nhe never came back. \"He didn't even finish his smoothie,\" Brian\n\nsaid. And now, in late 2008, it was the worst recession in decades.\n\nThe stock market was in free fall and wouldn't hit bottom for another\n\nfour months.Why hadn't they given up? This is a useful question to ask. People,\n\nlike matter, reveal their nature under extreme conditions. One thing\n\nthat's clear is that they weren't doing this just for the money.\n\nAs a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a year's work and\n\nall they had to show for it was a binder full of maxed-out credit\n\ncards. So why were they still working on this startup? Because of\n\nthe experience they'd had as the first hosts.When they first tried renting out airbeds on their floor during a\n\ndesign convention, all they were hoping for was to make enough money\n\nto pay their rent that month. But something surprising happened:\n\nthey enjoyed having those first three guests staying with them. And\n\nthe guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had done it\n\nbecause they were in a sense forced to, and yet they'd all had a\n\ngreat experience. Clearly there was something new here: for hosts,\n\na new way to make money that had literally been right under their\n\nnoses, and for guests, a new way to travel that was in many ways\n\nbetter than hotels.That experience was why the Airbnbs didn't give up. They knew they'd\n\ndiscovered something. They'd seen a glimpse of the future, and they\n\ncouldn't let it go.They knew that once people tried staying in what is now called \"an\n\nairbnb,\" they would also realize that this was the future. But only\n\nif they tried it, and they weren't. That was the problem during Y\n\nCombinator: to get growth started.Airbnb's goal during YC was to reach what we call ramen profitability,\n\nwhich means making enough money that the company can pay the founders'\n\nliving expenses, if they live on ramen noodles. Ramen profitability\n\nis not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it's the most\n\nimportant threshold on the way, because this is the point where\n\nyou're airborne. This is the point where you no longer need investors'\n\npermission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen profitability\n\nwas $4000 a month: $3500 for rent, and $500 for food. They taped\n\nthis goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their apartment.The way to get growth started in something like Airbnb is to focus\n\non the hottest subset of the market. If you can get growth started\n\nthere, it will spread to the rest. When I asked the Airbnbs where\n\nthere was most demand, they knew from searches: New York City. So\n\nthey focused on New York. They went there in person to visit their\n\nhosts and help them make their listings more attractive. A big part\n\nof that was better pictures. So Joe and Brian rented a professional\n\ncamera and took pictures of the hosts' places themselves.This didn't just make the listings better. It also taught them about\n\ntheir hosts. When they came back from their first trip to New York,\n\nI asked what they'd noticed about hosts that surprised them, and\n\nthey said the biggest surprise was how many of the hosts were in\n\nthe same position they'd been in: they needed this money to pay\n\ntheir rent. This was, remember, the worst recession in decades, and\n\nit had hit New York first. It definitely added to the Airbnbs' sense\n\nof mission to feel that people needed them.In late January 2009, about three weeks into Y Combinator, their\n\nefforts started to show results, and their numbers crept upward.\n\nBut it was hard to say for sure whether it was growth or just random\n\nfluctuation. By February it was clear that it was real growth. They\n\nmade $460 in fees in the first week of February, $897 in the second,\n\nand $1428 in the third. That was it: they were airborne. Brian sent\n\nme an email on February 22 announcing that they were ramen profitable\n\nand giving the last three weeks' numbers.\"I assume you know what you've now set yourself up for next week,\"\n\nI responded.Brian's reply was seven words: \"We are not going to slow down.\"", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1086, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:42.074317Z"}
{"id": "think", "title": "How to Think for Yourself", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/think.html", "date": null, "content": "November 2020There are some kinds of work that you can't do well without thinking\n\ndifferently from your peers. To be a successful scientist, for\n\nexample, it's not enough just to be correct. Your ideas have to be\n\nboth correct and novel. You can't publish papers saying things other\n\npeople already know. You need to say things no one else has realized\n\nyet.The same is true for investors. It's not enough for a public market\n\ninvestor to predict correctly how a company will do. If a lot of\n\nother people make the same prediction, the stock price will already\n\nreflect it, and there's no room to make money. The only valuable\n\ninsights are the ones most other investors don't share.You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don't want to\n\nstart a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea,\n\nor there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do\n\nsomething that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but\n\nthat you know isn't  like writing software for a tiny computer\n\nused by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people\n\nrent airbeds on strangers' floors.Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already\n\nknew would be boring. You have to tell them something new.But this pattern isn't universal. In fact, it doesn't hold for most\n\nkinds of work. In most kinds of work  to be an administrator, for\n\nexample  all you need is the first half. All you need is to be\n\nright. It's not essential that everyone else be wrong.There's room for a little novelty in most kinds of work, but in\n\npractice there's a fairly sharp distinction between the kinds of\n\nwork where it's essential to be independent-minded, and the kinds\n\nwhere it's not.I wish someone had told me about this distinction when I was a kid,\n\nbecause it's one of the most important things to think about when\n\nyou're deciding what kind of work you want to do. Do you want to\n\ndo the kind of work where you can only win by thinking differently\n\nfrom everyone else? I suspect most people's unconscious mind will\n\nanswer that question before their conscious mind has a chance to.\n\nI know mine does.Independent-mindedness seems to be more a matter of nature than\n\nnurture. Which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you're\n\ngoing to be unhappy. If you're naturally independent-minded, you're\n\ngoing to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. And if you're\n\nnaturally conventional-minded, you're going to be sailing into a\n\nheadwind if you try to do original research.One difficulty here, though, is that people are often mistaken about\n\nwhere they fall on the spectrum from conventional- to independent-minded.\n\nConventional-minded people don't like to think of themselves as\n\nconventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them\n\nas if they make up their own minds about everything. It's just a\n\ncoincidence that their beliefs are identical to their peers'. And\n\nthe independent-minded, meanwhile, are often unaware how different\n\ntheir ideas are from conventional ones, at least till they state\n\nthem publicly.\n\n[1]By the time they reach adulthood, most people know roughly how smart\n\nthey are (in the narrow sense of ability to solve pre-set problems),\n\nbecause they're constantly being tested and ranked according to it.\n\nBut schools generally ignore independent-mindedness, except to the\n\nextent they try to suppress it. So we don't get anything like the\n\nsame kind of feedback about how independent-minded we are.There may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, where\n\nthe most conventional-minded people are confident that they're\n\nindependent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worry\n\nthey might not be independent-minded enough.\n\n___________\n\nCan you make yourself more independent-minded? I think so. This\n\nquality may be largely inborn, but there seem to be ways to magnify\n\nit, or at least not to suppress it.One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally\n\nby most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs\n\nare. It's hard to be a conformist if you don't know what you're\n\nsupposed to conform to. Though again, it may be that such people\n\nalready are independent-minded. A conventional-minded person would\n\nprobably feel anxious not knowing what other people thought, and\n\nmake more effort to find out.It matters a lot who you surround yourself with. If you're surrounded\n\nby conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you\n\ncan express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have.\n\nBut if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you'll\n\nhave the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising\n\nthings will encourage you to, and to think of more.Because the independent-minded find it uncomfortable to be surrounded\n\nby conventional-minded people, they tend to self-segregate once\n\nthey have a chance to. The problem with high school is that they\n\nhaven't yet had a chance to. Plus high school tends to be an\n\ninward-looking little world whose inhabitants lack confidence, both\n\nof which magnify the forces of conformism.  So high school is\n\noften a bad time for the\n\nindependent-minded. But there is some advantage even here: it\n\nteaches you what to avoid. If you later find yourself in a situation\n\nthat makes you think \"this is like high school,\" you know you should\n\nget out.\n\n[2]Another place where the independent- and conventional-minded are\n\nthrown together is in successful startups. The founders and early\n\nemployees are almost always independent-minded; otherwise the startup\n\nwouldn't be successful. But conventional-minded people greatly\n\noutnumber independent-minded ones, so as the company grows, the\n\noriginal spirit of independent-mindedness is inevitably diluted.\n\nThis causes all kinds of problems besides the obvious one that the\n\ncompany starts to suck. One of the strangest is that the founders\n\nfind themselves able to speak more freely with founders of other\n\ncompanies than with their own employees.\n\n[3]Fortunately you don't have to spend all your time with independent-minded\n\npeople. It's enough to have one or two you can talk to regularly.\n\nAnd once you find them, they're usually as eager to talk as you\n\nare; they need you too. Although universities no longer have the\n\nkind of monopoly they used to have on education, good universities\n\nare still an excellent way to meet independent-minded people. Most\n\nstudents will still be conventional-minded, but you'll at least\n\nfind clumps of independent-minded ones, rather than the near zero\n\nyou may have found in high school.It also works to go in the other direction: as well as cultivating\n\na small collection of independent-minded friends, to try to meet\n\nas many different types of people as you can. It will decrease the\n\ninfluence of your immediate peers if you have several other groups\n\nof peers. Plus if you're part of several different worlds, you can\n\noften import ideas from one to another.But by different types of people, I don't mean demographically\n\ndifferent. For this technique to work, they have to think differently.\n\nSo while it's an excellent idea to go and visit other countries,\n\nyou can probably find people who think differently right around the\n\ncorner. When I meet someone who knows a lot about something unusual\n\n(which includes practically everyone, if you dig deep enough), I\n\ntry to learn what they know that other people don't. There are\n\nalmost always surprises here. It's a good way to make conversation\n\nwhen you meet strangers, but I don't do it to make conversation.\n\nI really want to know.You can expand the source of influences in time as well as space,\n\nby reading history. When I read history I do it not just to learn\n\nwhat happened, but to try to get inside the heads of people who\n\nlived in the past. How did things look to them? This is hard to do,\n\nbut worth the effort for the same reason it's worth travelling far\n\nto triangulate a point.You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from\n\nautomatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general is\n\nto cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone say\n\nsomething, stop and ask yourself \"Is that true?\" Don't say it out\n\nloud. I'm not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to\n\nyou the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take\n\nupon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later\n\nturn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is\n\nnot to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new\n\nideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game\n\nshould be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for\n\nintellectual hygiene. And you'll be surprised, when you start asking\n\n\"Is this true?\", how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If\n\nyou have any imagination, you're more likely to have too many leads\n\nto follow than too few.More generally your goal should be not to let anything into your\n\nhead unexamined, and things don't always enter your head in the\n\nform of statements. Some of the most powerful influences are implicit.\n\nHow do you even notice these? By standing back and watching how\n\nother people get their ideas.When you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas\n\nspreading through groups of people like waves. The most obvious are\n\nin fashion: you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt,\n\nand then more and more, until half the people around you are wearing\n\nthe same shirt. You may not care much what you wear, but there are\n\nintellectual fashions too, and you definitely don't want to participate\n\nin those. Not just because you want sovereignty over your own\n\nthoughts, but because unfashionable\n\nideas are disproportionately likely to lead somewhere interesting.\n\nThe best place to find undiscovered ideas is where no one else is\n\nlooking.\n\n[4]\n\n___________\n\nTo go beyond this general advice, we need to look at the internal\n\nstructure of independent-mindedness  at the individual muscles\n\nwe need to exercise, as it were. It seems to me that it has three\n\ncomponents: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told\n\nwhat to think, and curiosity.Fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things\n\nthat are false. It means being careful about degree of belief. For\n\nmost people, degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes:\n\nthe unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain.\n\n[5]\n\nTo the independent-minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy.\n\nThey're willing to have anything in their heads, from highly\n\nspeculative hypotheses to (apparent) tautologies, but on subjects\n\nthey care about, everything has to be labelled with a carefully\n\nconsidered degree of belief.\n\n[6]The independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which\n\nrequire one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once, and\n\nto treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded person\n\nthat would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious\n\nabout food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a\n\nlarge variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance.Without this fastidiousness about truth, you can't be truly\n\nindependent-minded. It's not enough just to have resistance to being\n\ntold what to think. Those kind of people reject conventional ideas\n\nonly to replace them with the most random conspiracy theories. And\n\nsince these conspiracy theories have often been manufactured to\n\ncapture them, they end up being less independent-minded than ordinary\n\npeople, because they're subject to a much more exacting master than\n\nmere convention.\n\n[7]Can you increase your fastidiousness about truth? I would think so.\n\nIn my experience, merely thinking about something you're fastidious\n\nabout causes that fastidiousness to grow. If so, this is one of\n\nthose rare virtues we can have more of merely by wanting it. And\n\nif it's like other forms of fastidiousness, it should also be\n\npossible to encourage in children. I certainly got a strong dose\n\nof it from my father.\n\n[8]The second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to being\n\ntold what to think, is the most visible of the three. But even this\n\nis often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is to\n\nthink of it as a merely negative quality. The language we use\n\nreinforces that idea. You're unconventional. You don't care\n\nwhat other people think. But it's not just a kind of immunity. In\n\nthe most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what\n\nto think is a positive force. It's not mere skepticism, but an\n\nactive delight in ideas that subvert\n\nthe conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better.Some of the most novel ideas seemed at the time almost like practical\n\njokes. Think how often your reaction to a novel idea is to laugh.\n\nI don't think it's because novel ideas are funny per se, but because\n\nnovelty and humor share a certain kind of surprisingness. But while\n\nnot identical, the two are close enough that there is a definite\n\ncorrelation between having a sense of humor and being independent-minded\n\n just as there is between being humorless and being conventional-minded.\n\n[9]I don't think we can significantly increase our resistance to being\n\ntold what to think. It seems the most innate of the three components\n\nof independent-mindedness; people who have this quality as adults\n\nusually showed all too visible signs of it as children. But if we\n\ncan't increase our resistance to being told what to think, we can\n\nat least shore it up, by surrounding ourselves with other\n\nindependent-minded people.The third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may be\n\nthe most interesting. To the extent that we can give a brief answer\n\nto the question of where novel ideas come from, it's curiosity. That's\n\nwhat people are usually feeling before having them.In my experience, independent-mindedness and curiosity predict one\n\nanother perfectly. Everyone I know who's independent-minded is\n\ndeeply curious, and everyone I know who's conventional-minded isn't.\n\nExcept, curiously, children. All small children are curious. Perhaps\n\nthe reason is that even the conventional-minded have to be curious\n\nin the beginning, in order to learn what the conventions are. Whereas\n\nthe independent-minded are the gluttons of curiosity, who keep\n\neating even after they're full.\n\n[10]The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert:\n\nfastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to\n\nthink leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to\n\nfill it.Interestingly, the three components can substitute for one another\n\nin much the same way muscles can. If you're sufficiently fastidious\n\nabout truth, you don't need to be as resistant to being told what\n\nto think, because fastidiousness alone will create sufficient gaps\n\nin your knowledge. And either one can compensate for curiosity,\n\nbecause if you create enough space in your brain, your discomfort\n\nat the resulting vacuum will add force to your curiosity. Or curiosity\n\ncan compensate for them: if you're sufficiently curious, you don't\n\nneed to clear space in your brain, because the new ideas you discover\n\nwill push out the conventional ones you acquired by default.Because the components of independent-mindedness are so interchangeable,\n\nyou can have them to varying degrees and still get the same result.\n\nSo there is not just a single model of independent-mindedness. Some\n\nindependent-minded people are openly subversive, and others are\n\nquietly curious. They all know the secret handshake though.Is there a way to cultivate curiosity? To start with, you want to\n\navoid situations that suppress it. How much does the work you're\n\ncurrently doing engage your curiosity? If the answer is \"not much,\"\n\nmaybe you should change something.The most important active step you can take to cultivate your\n\ncuriosity is probably to seek out the topics that engage it. Few\n\nadults are equally curious about everything, and it doesn't seem\n\nas if you can choose which topics interest you. So it's up to you\n\nto find them. Or invent them, if\n\nnecessary.Another way to increase your curiosity is to indulge it, by\n\ninvestigating things you're interested in. Curiosity is unlike\n\nmost other appetites in this respect: indulging it tends to increase\n\nrather than to sate it. Questions lead to more questions.Curiosity seems to be more individual than fastidiousness about\n\ntruth or resistance to being told what to think. To the degree\n\npeople have the latter two, they're usually pretty general, whereas\n\ndifferent people can be curious about very different things. So\n\nperhaps curiosity is the compass here. Perhaps, if your goal is to\n\ndiscover novel ideas, your motto should not be \"do what you love\"\n\nso much as \"do what you're curious about.\"Notes[1]\n\nOne convenient consequence of the fact that no one identifies\n\nas conventional-minded is that you can say what you like about\n\nconventional-minded people without getting in too much trouble.\n\nWhen I wrote \"The Four Quadrants of\n\nConformism\" I expected a firestorm of rage from the\n\naggressively conventional-minded, but in fact it was quite muted.\n\nThey sensed that there was something about the essay that they\n\ndisliked intensely, but they had a hard time finding a specific\n\npassage to pin it on.[2]\n\nWhen I ask myself what in my life is like high school, the\n\nanswer is Twitter. It's not just full of conventional-minded people,\n\nas anything its size will inevitably be, but subject to violent\n\nstorms of conventional-mindedness that remind me of descriptions\n\nof Jupiter. But while it probably is a net loss to spend time there,\n\nit has at least made me think more about the distinction between\n\nindependent- and conventional-mindedness, which I probably wouldn't\n\nhave done otherwise.[3]\n\nThe decrease in independent-mindedness in growing startups is\n\nstill an open problem, but there may be solutions.Founders can delay the problem by making a conscious effort only\n\nto hire independent-minded people. Which of course also has the\n\nancillary benefit that they have better ideas.Another possible solution is to create policies that somehow disrupt\n\nthe force of conformism, much as control rods slow chain reactions,\n\nso that the conventional-minded aren't as dangerous. The physical\n\nseparation of Lockheed's Skunk Works may have had this as a side\n\nbenefit. Recent examples suggest employee forums like Slack may not\n\nbe an unmitigated good.The most radical solution would be to grow revenues without growing\n\nthe company. You think hiring that junior PR person will be cheap,\n\ncompared to a programmer, but what will be the effect on the average\n\nlevel of independent-mindedness in your company? (The growth in\n\nstaff relative to faculty seems to have had a similar effect on\n\nuniversities.) Perhaps the rule about outsourcing work that's not\n\nyour \"core competency\" should be augmented by one about outsourcing\n\nwork done by people who'd ruin your culture as employees.Some investment firms already seem to be able to grow revenues\n\nwithout growing the number of employees. Automation plus the ever\n\nincreasing articulation of the \"tech stack\" suggest this may one\n\nday be possible for product companies.[4]\n\nThere are intellectual fashions in every field, but their\n\ninfluence varies. One of the reasons politics, for example, tends\n\nto be boring is that it's so extremely subject to them. The threshold\n\nfor having opinions about politics is much lower than the one for having\n\nopinions about set theory. So while there are some ideas in politics,\n\nin practice they tend to be swamped by waves of intellectual fashion.[5]\n\nThe conventional-minded are often fooled by the strength of\n\ntheir opinions into believing that they're independent-minded. But\n\nstrong convictions are not a sign of independent-mindedness. Rather\n\nthe opposite.[6]\n\nFastidiousness about truth doesn't imply that an independent-minded\n\nperson won't be dishonest, but that he won't be deluded. It's sort\n\nof like the definition of a gentleman as someone who is never\n\nunintentionally rude.[7]\n\nYou see this especially among political extremists. They think\n\nthemselves nonconformists, but actually they're niche conformists.\n\nTheir opinions may be different from the average person's, but they\n\nare often more influenced by their peers' opinions than the average\n\nperson's are.[8]\n\nIf we broaden the concept of fastidiousness about truth so that\n\nit excludes pandering, bogusness, and pomposity as well as falsehood\n\nin the strict sense, our model of independent-mindedness can expand\n\nfurther into the arts.[9]\n\nThis correlation is far from perfect, though. Gödel and Dirac\n\ndon't seem to have been very strong in the humor department. But\n\nsomeone who is both \"neurotypical\" and humorless is very likely to\n\nbe conventional-minded.[10]\n\nException: gossip. Almost everyone is curious about gossip.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 3372, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:42.673130Z"}
{"id": "early", "title": "Early Work", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/early.html", "date": null, "content": "October 2020One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work\n\nis the fear of making something lame. And this fear is not an\n\nirrational one. Many great projects go through a stage early on\n\nwhere they don't seem very impressive, even to their creators. You\n\nhave to push through this stage to reach the great work that lies\n\nbeyond. But many people don't. Most people don't even reach the\n\nstage of making something they're embarrassed by, let alone continue\n\npast it. They're too frightened even to start.Imagine if we could turn off the fear of making something lame.\n\nImagine how much more we'd do.Is there any hope of turning it off? I think so. I think the habits\n\nat work here are not very deeply rooted.Making new things is itself a new thing for us as a species. It has\n\nalways happened, but till the last few centuries it happened so\n\nslowly as to be invisible to individual humans. And since we didn't\n\nneed customs for dealing with new ideas, we didn't develop any.We just don't have enough experience with early versions of ambitious\n\nprojects to know how to respond to them. We judge them as we would\n\njudge more finished work, or less ambitious projects. We don't\n\nrealize they're a special case.Or at least, most of us don't. One reason I'm confident we can do\n\nbetter is that it's already starting to happen. There are already\n\na few places that are living in the future in this respect. Silicon\n\nValley is one of them: an unknown person working on a strange-sounding\n\nidea won't automatically be dismissed the way they would back home.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, people have learned how dangerous that is.The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challenge\n\nto your imagination  not just to have lower standards, but to\n\nswitch polarity entirely, from listing\n\nthe reasons an idea won't\n\nwork to trying to think of ways it could. That's what I do when I\n\nmeet people with new ideas. I've become quite good at it, but I've\n\nhad a lot of practice. Being a partner at Y Combinator means being\n\npractically immersed in strange-sounding ideas proposed by unknown\n\npeople. Every six months you get thousands of new ones thrown at\n\nyou and have to sort through them, knowing that in a world with a\n\npower-law distribution of outcomes, it will be painfully obvious\n\nif you miss the needle in this haystack. Optimism becomes\n\nurgent.But I'm hopeful that, with time, this kind of optimism can become\n\nwidespread enough that it becomes a social custom, not just a trick\n\nused by a few specialists. It is after all an extremely lucrative\n\ntrick, and those tend to spread quickly.Of course, inexperience is not the only reason people are too harsh\n\non early versions of ambitious projects. They also do it to seem\n\nclever. And in a field where the new ideas are risky, like startups,\n\nthose who dismiss them are in fact more likely to be right. Just\n\nnot when their predictions are\n\nweighted by outcome.But there is another more sinister reason people dismiss new ideas.\n\nIf you try something ambitious, many of those around you will hope,\n\nconsciously or unconsciously, that you'll fail. They worry that if\n\nyou try something ambitious and succeed, it will put you above them.\n\nIn some countries this is not just an individual failing but part\n\nof the national culture.I wouldn't claim that people in Silicon Valley overcome these\n\nimpulses because they're morally better.\n\n[1]\n\nThe reason many hope\n\nyou'll succeed is that they hope to rise with you. For investors\n\nthis incentive is particularly explicit. They want you to succeed\n\nbecause they hope you'll make them rich in the process. But many\n\nother people you meet can hope to benefit in some way from your\n\nsuccess. At the very least they'll be able to say, when you're\n\nfamous, that they've known you since way back.But even if Silicon Valley's encouraging attitude\n\nis rooted in self-interest, it has over time actually grown into a\n\nsort of benevolence. Encouraging startups has been practiced for\n\nso long that it has become a custom. Now it just seems that that's\n\nwhat one does with startups.Maybe Silicon Valley is too optimistic. Maybe it's too easily fooled\n\nby impostors. Many less optimistic journalists want to believe that.\n\nBut the lists of impostors they cite are suspiciously short, and\n\nplagued with asterisks.\n\n[2] If you use revenue as the test, Silicon\n\nValley's optimism seems better tuned than the rest of the world's.\n\nAnd because it works, it will spread.There's a lot more to new ideas than new startup ideas, of course.\n\nThe fear of making something lame holds people back in every field.\n\nBut Silicon Valley shows how quickly customs can evolve to support\n\nnew ideas. And that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas is not\n\nso deeply rooted in human nature that it can't be unlearnt.\n\n___________\n\nUnfortunately, if you want to do new things, you'll face a force\n\nmore powerful than other people's skepticism: your own skepticism.\n\nYou too will judge your early work too harshly. How do you avoid\n\nthat?This is a difficult problem, because you don't want to completely\n\neliminate your horror of making something lame. That's what steers\n\nyou toward doing good work. You just want to turn it off temporarily,\n\nthe way a painkiller temporarily turns off pain.People have already discovered several techniques that work. Hardy\n\nmentions two in A Mathematician's Apology:\n\nGood work is not done by \"humble\" men. It is one of the first\n\nduties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate\n\na little both the importance of his subject and his importance\n\nin it.\n\nIf you overestimate the importance of what you're working on, that\n\nwill compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment of your initial\n\nresults. If you look at something that's 20% of the way to a goal\n\nworth 100 and conclude that it's 10% of the way to a goal worth\n\n200, your estimate of its expected value is correct even though\n\nboth components are wrong.It also helps, as Hardy suggests, to be slightly overconfident.\n\nI've noticed in many fields that the most successful people are\n\nslightly overconfident. On the face of it this seems implausible.\n\nSurely it would be optimal to have exactly the right estimate of\n\none's abilities. How could it be an advantage to be mistaken?\n\nBecause this error compensates for other sources of error in the\n\nopposite direction: being slightly overconfident armors you against\n\nboth other people's skepticism and your own.Ignorance has a similar effect. It's safe to make the mistake of\n\njudging early work as finished work if you're a sufficiently lax\n\njudge of finished work. I doubt it's possible to cultivate this\n\nkind of ignorance, but empirically it's a real advantage, especially\n\nfor the young.Another way to get through the lame phase of ambitious projects is\n\nto surround yourself with the right people  to create an eddy in\n\nthe social headwind. But it's not enough to collect people who are\n\nalways encouraging. You'd learn to discount that. You need colleagues\n\nwho can actually tell an ugly duckling from a baby swan. The people\n\nbest able to do this are those working on similar projects of their\n\nown, which is why university departments and research labs work so\n\nwell. You don't need institutions to collect colleagues. They\n\nnaturally coalesce, given the chance. But it's very much worth\n\naccelerating this process by seeking out other people trying to do\n\nnew things.Teachers are in effect a special case of colleagues. It's a teacher's\n\njob both to see the promise of early work and to encourage you to\n\ncontinue. But teachers who are good at this are unfortunately quite\n\nrare, so if you have the opportunity to learn from one, take it.\n\n[3]For some it might work to rely on sheer discipline: to tell yourself\n\nthat you just have to press on through the initial crap phase and\n\nnot get discouraged. But like a lot of \"just tell yourself\" advice,\n\nthis is harder than it sounds. And it gets still harder as you get\n\nolder, because your standards rise. The old do have one compensating\n\nadvantage though: they've been through this before.It can help if you focus less on where you are and more on the rate\n\nof change. You won't worry so much about doing bad work if you can\n\nsee it improving. Obviously the faster it improves, the easier this\n\nis. So when you start something new, it's good if you can spend a\n\nlot of time on it. That's another advantage of being young: you\n\ntend to have bigger blocks of time.Another common trick is to start by considering new work to be of\n\na different, less exacting type. To start a painting saying that\n\nit's just a sketch, or a new piece of software saying that it's\n\njust a quick hack. Then you judge your initial results by a lower\n\nstandard. Once the project is rolling you can sneakily convert it\n\nto something more.\n\n[4]This will be easier if you use a medium that lets you work fast and\n\ndoesn't require too much commitment up front. It's easier to convince\n\nyourself that something is just a sketch when you're drawing in a\n\nnotebook than when you're carving stone. Plus you get initial results\n\nfaster.\n\n[5]\n\n[6]It will be easier to try out a risky project if you think of it as\n\na way to learn and not just as a way to make something. Then even\n\nif the project truly is a failure, you'll still have gained by it.\n\nIf the problem is sharply enough defined, failure itself is\n\nknowledge: if the theorem you're trying to prove turns out to\n\nbe false, or you use a structural member of a certain size and\n\nit fails under stress, you've learned something, even if it\n\nisn't what you wanted to learn.\n\n[7]One motivation that works particularly well for me is curiosity.\n\nI like to try new things just to see how they'll turn out. We started\n\nY Combinator in this spirit, and it was one of main things that\n\nkept me going while I was working on\n\nBel. Having worked for so long\n\nwith various dialects of Lisp, I was very curious to see what its\n\ninherent shape was: what you'd end up with if you followed the\n\naxiomatic approach all the way.But it's a bit strange that you have to play mind games with yourself\n\nto avoid being discouraged by lame-looking early efforts. The thing\n\nyou're trying to trick yourself into believing is in fact the truth.\n\nA lame-looking early version of an ambitious project truly is more\n\nvaluable than it seems. So the ultimate solution may be to teach\n\nyourself that.One way to do it is to study the histories of people who've\n\ndone great work. What were they thinking early on? What was the\n\nvery first thing they did? It can sometimes be hard to get an\n\naccurate answer to this question, because people are often embarrassed\n\nby their earliest work and make little effort to publish it. (They\n\ntoo misjudge it.) But when you can get an accurate picture of the\n\nfirst steps someone made on the path to some great work, they're\n\noften pretty feeble.\n\n[8]Perhaps if you study enough such cases, you can teach yourself to\n\nbe a better judge of early work. Then you'll be immune both to other\n\npeople's skepticism and your own fear of making something lame.\n\nYou'll see early work for what it is.Curiously enough, the solution to the problem of judging early work\n\ntoo harshly is to realize that our attitudes toward it are themselves\n\nearly work. Holding everything to the same standard is a crude\n\nversion 1. We're already evolving better customs, and we can already\n\nsee signs of how big the payoff will be.\n\nNotes[1]\n\nThis assumption may be too conservative. There is some evidence\n\nthat historically the Bay Area has attracted a\n\ndifferent sort of person than,\n\nsay, New York City.[2]\n\nOne of their great favorites is Theranos. But the most conspicuous\n\nfeature of Theranos's cap table is the absence of Silicon Valley\n\nfirms. Journalists were fooled by Theranos, but Silicon Valley\n\ninvestors weren't.[3]\n\nI made two mistakes about teachers when I was younger.  I\n\ncared more about professors' research than their reputations as\n\nteachers, and I was also wrong about what it meant to be a good\n\nteacher. I thought it simply meant to be good at explaining things.[4]\n\nPatrick Collison points out that you can go past treating\n\nsomething as a hack in the sense of a prototype and onward to the\n\nsense of the word that means something closer to a practical joke:\n\nI think there may be something related to being a hack that can\n\nbe powerful  the idea of making the tenuousness and implausibility\n\na feature. \"Yes, it's a bit ridiculous, right?  I'm just trying\n\nto see how far such a naive approach can get.\" YC seemed to me\n\nto have this characteristic.\n\n[5]\n\nMuch of the advantage of switching from physical to digital\n\nmedia is not the software per se but that it lets you start something\n\nnew with little upfront commitment.[6]\n\nJohn Carmack adds:\n\nThe value of a medium without a vast gulf between the early work\n\nand the final work is exemplified in game mods. The original\n\nQuake game was a golden age for mods, because everything was very\n\nflexible, but so crude due to technical limitations, that quick\n\nhacks to try out a gameplay idea weren't all that far from the\n\nofficial game. Many careers were born from that, but as the\n\ncommercial game quality improved over the years, it became almost\n\na full time job to make a successful mod that would be appreciated\n\nby the community. This was dramatically reversed with Minecraft\n\nand later Roblox, where the entire esthetic of the experience was\n\nso explicitly crude that innovative gameplay concepts became the\n\noverriding value. These \"crude\" game mods by single authors are\n\nnow often bigger deals than massive professional teams' work.\n\n[7]\n\nLisa Randall suggests that we\n\ntreat new things as experiments. That way there's no such thing\n\nas failing, since you learn something no matter what. You treat\n\nit like an experiment in the sense that if it really rules something\n\nout, you give up and move on, but if there's some way to vary it\n\nto make it work better, go ahead and do that\n\n[8]\n\nMichael Nielsen points out that the internet has made this\n\neasier, because you can see programmers' first commits, musicians'\n\nfirst videos, and so on.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Carmack, Patrick Collison, Jessica\n\nLivingston, Michael Nielsen, and Lisa Randall for reading drafts\n\nof this.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 2467, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:43.262499Z"}
{"id": "wtax", "title": "Modeling a Wealth Tax", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/wtax.html", "date": null, "content": "August 2020Some politicians are proposing to introduce wealth taxes in addition\n\nto income and capital gains taxes. Let's try modeling the effects of various levels\n\nof wealth tax to see what they would mean in practice for a startup\n\nfounder.Suppose you start a successful startup in your twenties, and then\n\nlive for another 60 years. How much of your stock will a wealth tax\n\nconsume?If the wealth tax applies to all your assets, it's easy to\n\ncalculate its effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep\n\n99% of your stock each year. After 60 years the proportion\n\nof stock you'll have left will be .99^60, or .547. So a\n\nstraight 1% wealth tax means the government will over the\n\ncourse of your life take 45% of your stock.(Losing shares does not, obviously, mean becoming net\n\npoorer unless the value per share is increasing by less than the\n\nwealth tax rate.)Here's how much stock the government would take over 60\n\nyears at various levels of wealth tax:\n\nwealth taxgovernment takes\n\n0.1%6%0.5%26%\n\n1.0%45%\n\n2.0%70%\n\n3.0%84%\n\n4.0%91%5.0%95%\n\nA wealth tax will usually have a threshold at which it starts.\n\nHow much difference would a high threshold make? To model that,\n\nwe need to make some assumptions about the initial value of\n\nyour stock and the growth rate.Suppose your stock is initially\n\nworth $2 million, and the company's trajectory is as follows:\n\nthe value of your stock grows 3x for 2 years, then 2x for 2 years,\n\nthen 50% for 2 years, after\n\nwhich you just get a typical public company growth rate,\n\nwhich we'll call 8%.\n\n[1]\n\nSuppose the wealth tax threshold is\n\n$50 million. How much stock does the government take now?\n\nwealth taxgovernment takes\n\n0.1%5%0.5%23%\n\n1.0%41%\n\n2.0%65%\n\n3.0%79%\n\n4.0%88%5.0%93%\n\nIt may at first seem surprising that such apparently small tax rates\n\nproduce such dramatic effects.

{"id": "conformism", "title": "The Four Quadrants of Conformism", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html", "date": null, "content": "July 2020One of the most revealing ways to classify people is by the degree\n\nand aggressiveness of their conformism. Imagine a Cartesian coordinate\n\nsystem whose horizontal axis runs from conventional-minded on the\n\nleft to independent-minded on the right, and whose vertical axis\n\nruns from passive at the bottom to aggressive at the top. The\n\nresulting four quadrants define four types of people. Starting in\n\nthe upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressively\n\nconventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passively\n\nindependent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded.I think that you'll find all four types in most societies, and that\n\nwhich quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personality\n\nthan the beliefs prevalent in their society.\n\n[1]Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points.\n\nAnyone who's been to primary school has seen the four types, and\n\nthe fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence that\n\nwhich quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules.The kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-minded\n\nones, are the tattletales. They believe not only that rules must\n\nbe obeyed, but that those who disobey them must be punished.The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded,\n\nare the sheep. They're careful to obey the rules, but when other\n\nkids break them, their impulse is to worry that those kids will be\n\npunished, not to ensure that they will.The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded,\n\nare the dreamy ones. They don't care much about rules and probably\n\naren't 100% sure what the rules even are.And the kids in the upper right quadrant, the aggressively\n\nindependent-minded, are the naughty ones. When they see a rule,\n\ntheir first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what to\n\ndo makes them inclined to do the opposite.When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respect\n\nto what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids it's\n\nthe rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rules\n\nbecomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout school\n\nrules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite.In adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctive\n\ncalls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The call\n\nof the aggressively conventional-minded is \"Crush <outgroup>!\" (It's\n\nrather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, but\n\nthat's the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.)\n\nThe call of the passively conventional-minded is \"What will the\n\nneighbors think?\" The call of the passively independent-minded is\n\n\"To each his own.\" And the call of the aggressively independent-minded\n\nis \"Eppur si muove.\"The four types are not equally common. There are more passive people\n\nthan aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people than\n\nindependent-minded ones. So the passively conventional-minded are\n\nthe largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded the\n\nsmallest.Since one's quadrant depends more on one's personality than the\n\nnature of the rules, most people would occupy the same quadrant\n\neven if they'd grown up in a quite different society.Princeton professor Robert George recently wrote:\n\nI sometimes ask students what their position on slavery would\n\nhave been had they been white and living in the South before\n\nabolition. Guess what? They all would have been abolitionists!\n\nThey all would have bravely spoken out against slavery, and\n\nworked tirelessly against it.\n\nHe's too polite to say so, but of course they wouldn't. And indeed,\n\nour default assumption should not merely be that his students would,\n\non average, have behaved the same way people did at the time, but\n\nthat the ones who are aggressively conventional-minded today would\n\nhave been aggressively conventional-minded then too. In other words,\n\nthat they'd not only not have fought against slavery, but that\n\nthey'd have been among its staunchest defenders.I'm biased, I admit, but it seems to me that aggressively\n\nconventional-minded people are responsible for a disproportionate\n\namount of the trouble in the world, and that a lot of the customs\n\nwe've evolved since the Enlightenment have been designed to protect\n\nthe rest of us from them. In particular, the retirement of the\n\nconcept of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freely\n\ndebating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currently\n\nconsidered unacceptable, without any punishment for those who try\n\nthem out to see if they work.\n\n[2]Why do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Because\n\nthey have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, for\n\nexample, it's not enough just to be right. You have to be right\n\nwhen everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can't do\n\nthat. For similar reasons, all successful startup CEOs are not\n\nmerely independent-minded, but aggressively so. So it's no coincidence\n\nthat societies prosper only to the extent that they have customs\n\nfor keeping the conventional-minded at bay.\n\n[3]In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customs\n\nprotecting free inquiry have been weakened. Some say we're overreacting\n\n that they haven't been weakened very much, or that they've been\n\nweakened in the service of a greater good. The latter I'll dispose\n\nof immediately. When the conventional-minded get the upper hand,\n\nthey always say it's in the service of a greater good.  It just\n\nhappens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time.As for the former worry, that the independent-minded are being\n\noversensitive, and that free inquiry hasn't been shut down that\n\nmuch, you can't judge that unless you are yourself independent-minded.\n\nYou can't know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped off\n\nunless you have them, and only the independent-minded have the ones\n\nat the edges. Precisely because of this, they tend to be very\n\nsensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. They're\n\nthe canaries in this coalmine.The conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they don't\n\nwant to shut down the discussion of all ideas, just the bad ones.You'd think it would be obvious just from that sentence what a\n\ndangerous game they're playing. But I'll spell it out. There are\n\ntwo reasons why we need to be able to discuss even \"bad\" ideas.The first is that any process for deciding which ideas to ban is\n\nbound to make mistakes. All the more so because no one intelligent\n\nwants to undertake that kind of work, so it ends up being done by\n\nthe stupid. And when a process makes a lot of mistakes, you need\n\nto leave a margin for error. Which in this case means you need to\n\nban fewer ideas than you'd like to. But that's hard for the\n\naggressively conventional-minded to do, partly because they enjoy\n\nseeing people punished, as they have since they were children, and\n\npartly because they compete with one another. Enforcers of orthodoxy\n\ncan't allow a borderline idea to exist, because that gives other\n\nenforcers an opportunity to one-up them in the moral purity department,\n\nand perhaps even to turn enforcer upon them. So instead of getting\n\nthe margin for error we need, we get the opposite: a race to the\n\nbottom in which any idea that seems at all bannable ends up being\n\nbanned.\n\n[4]The second reason it's dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is\n\nthat ideas are more closely related than they look. Which means if\n\nyou restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn't only affect\n\nthose topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic that\n\nyields implications in the forbidden ones. And that is not an edge\n\ncase. The best ideas do exactly that: they have consequences\n\nin fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a world\n\nwhere some ideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch that\n\nhas a minefield in one corner. You don't just play the same game\n\nyou would have, but on a different shaped pitch. You play a much\n\nmore subdued game even on the ground that's safe.In the past, the way the independent-minded protected themselves\n\nwas to congregate in a handful of places   first in courts, and\n\nlater in universities  where they could to some extent make their\n\nown rules. Places where people work with ideas tend to have customs\n\nprotecting free inquiry, for the same reason wafer fabs have powerful\n\nair filters, or recording studios good sound insulation. For the\n\nlast couple centuries at least, when the aggressively conventional-minded\n\nwere on the rampage for whatever reason, universities were the\n\nsafest places to be.That may not work this time though, due to the unfortunate fact\n\nthat the latest wave of intolerance began in universities. It began\n\nin the mid 1980s, and by 2000 seemed to have died down, but it has\n\nrecently flared up again with the arrival of social media. This\n\nseems, unfortunately, to have been an own goal by Silicon Valley.\n\nThough the people who run Silicon Valley are almost all independent-minded,\n\nthey've handed the aggressively conventional-minded a tool such as\n\nthey could only have dreamed of.On the other hand, perhaps the decline in the spirit of free inquiry\n\nwithin universities is as much the symptom of the departure of the\n\nindependent-minded as the cause. People who would have become\n\nprofessors 50 years ago have other options now. Now they can become\n\nquants or start startups. You have to be independent-minded to\n\nsucceed at either of those. If these people had been professors,\n\nthey'd have put up a stiffer resistance on behalf of academic\n\nfreedom. So perhaps the picture of the independent-minded fleeing\n\ndeclining universities is too gloomy. Perhaps the universities are\n\ndeclining because so many have already left.\n\n[5]Though I've spent a lot of time thinking about this situation, I\n\ncan't predict how it plays out. Could some universities reverse the\n\ncurrent trend and remain places where the independent-minded want\n\nto congregate? Or will the independent-minded gradually abandon\n\nthem? I worry a lot about what we might lose if that happened.But I'm hopeful long term. The independent-minded are good at\n\nprotecting themselves. If existing institutions are compromised,\n\nthey'll create new ones. That may require some imagination. But\n\nimagination is, after all, their specialty.\n\nNotes[1]\n\nI realize of course that if people's personalities vary in any\n\ntwo ways, you can use them as axes and call the resulting four\n\nquadrants personality types. So what I'm really claiming is that\n\nthe axes are orthogonal and that there's significant variation in\n\nboth.[2]\n\nThe aggressively conventional-minded aren't responsible for all\n\nthe trouble in the world. Another big source of trouble is the sort\n\nof charismatic leader who gains power by appealing to them. They\n\nbecome much more dangerous when such leaders emerge.[3]\n\nI never worried about writing things that offended the\n\nconventional-minded when I was running Y Combinator. If YC were a\n\ncookie company, I'd have faced a difficult moral choice.\n\nConventional-minded people eat cookies too. But they don't start\n\nsuccessful startups. So if I deterred them from applying to YC, the\n\nonly effect was to save us work reading applications.[4]\n\nThere has been progress in one area: the punishments for talking\n\nabout banned ideas are less severe than in the past. There's little\n\ndanger of being killed, at least in richer countries. The aggressively\n\nconventional-minded are mostly satisfied with getting people fired.[5]\n\nMany professors are independent-minded  especially in math,\n\nthe hard sciences, and engineering, where you have to be to succeed.\n\nBut students are more representative of the general population, and\n\nthus mostly conventional-minded. So when professors and students\n\nare in conflict, it's not just a conflict between generations but\n\nalso between different types of people.Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Nicholas Christakis, Patrick\n\nCollison, Sam Gichuru, Jessica Livingston, Patrick McKenzie, Geoff\n\nRalston, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.German TranslationKorean TranslationSerbian Translation", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1942, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:44.471350Z"}
{"id": "orth", "title": "Orthodox Privilege", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/orth.html", "date": "2020-07", "content": "\"Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.\" Einstein\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about privilege lately. Although the\n\nconcept is overused, there is something to it, and in particular\n\nto the idea that privilege makes you blind  that you can't see\n\nthings that are visible to someone whose life is very different\n\nfrom yours.But one of the most pervasive examples of this kind of blindness\n\nis one that I haven't seen mentioned explicitly. I'm going to call\n\nit orthodox privilege: The more conventional-minded someone is, the\n\nmore it seems to them that it's safe for everyone to express their\n\nopinions.It's safe for them to express their opinions, because the source\n\nof their opinions is whatever it's currently acceptable to believe.\n\nSo it seems to them that it must be safe for everyone. They literally\n\ncan't imagine a true statement that would get you in trouble.And yet at every point in history, there were\n\ntrue things that would\n\nget you in trouble to say.\n\nIs ours the first where this\n\nisn't so? What an amazing coincidence that would be.Surely it should at least be the default assumption that our time\n\nis not unique, and that there are true things you can't say now,\n\njust as there have always been. You would think. But even in the\n\nface of such overwhelming historical evidence, most people will go\n\nwith their gut on this one.In the most extreme cases, people suffering from orthodox\n\nprivilege will not only deny that there's anything true that\n\nyou can't say, but will accuse you of heresy merely for saying there is.\n\nThough if there's more than one heresy current in\n\nyour time, these accusations will be weirdly non-deterministic:\n\nyou must either be an xist or a yist.Frustrating as it is to deal with these people, it's important to\n\nrealize that they're in earnest. They're not pretending they think\n\nit's impossible for an idea to be both unorthodox and true. The\n\nworld really looks that way to them.Indeed, this is a uniquely tenacious form of privilege. People can\n\novercome the blindness induced by most forms of privilege by learning\n\nmore about whatever they're not. But they can't overcome orthodox\n\nprivilege just by learning more. They'd have to become more\n\nindependent-minded. If that happens at all, it doesn't happen on\n\nthe time scale of one conversation.It may be possible to convince some people that orthodox privilege\n\nmust exist even though they can't sense it, just as one can with,\n\nsay, dark matter. There may be some who could be convinced, for\n\nexample, that it's very unlikely that this is the first point in\n\nhistory at which there's nothing true you can't say, even if they\n\ncan't imagine specific examples.But in general I don't think it will work to say\n\n\"check your privilege\" about this type of privilege, because those\n\nin its demographic don't realize they're in it. It doesn't seem to\n\nconventional-minded people that they're conventional-minded. It\n\njust seems to them that they're right. Indeed, they tend to be\n\nparticularly sure of it.Perhaps the solution is to appeal to politeness. If someone says\n\nthey can hear a high-pitched noise that you can't, it's only polite\n\nto take them at their word, instead of demanding evidence that's\n\nimpossible to produce, or simply denying that they hear anything.\n\nImagine how rude that would seem. Similarly, if someone says they\n\ncan think of things that are true but that cannot be said, it's\n\nonly polite to take them at their word, even if you can't think of\n\nany yourself.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 609, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:45.074692Z"}

{"id": "useful", "title": "How to Write Usefully", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/useful.html", "date": null, "content": "February 2020What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's\n\nwhat a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can\n\naim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough\n\nmerely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by\n\nmaking it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for\n\nexample. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go\n\nwrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are\n\nmany factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too\n\nsimplistic a view of it, and so on.Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.\n\nUseful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made\n\nwithout becoming false.For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the\n\nmiddle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say\n\nit's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because\n\nit's a bit east of the middle.Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to\n\nsatisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous\n\nacademic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues.\n\nUseful writing is bold, but true.It's also two other things: it tells people something important,\n\nand that at least some of them didn't already know.Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean\n\nsurprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they\n\nknew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may\n\nbe the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more\n\nfundamental.Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something\n\ntrue and important that they didn't already know, and tells them\n\nas unequivocally as possible.Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't\n\nexpect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have\n\nwill probably have already been had by at least one of the world's\n\n7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot\n\nof readers.Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four\n\ncomponents are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score\n\nfor usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but\n\nnonetheless true._____\n\nHow can you ensure that the things you say are true and novel and\n\nimportant? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I\n\nlearned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying\n\nanything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure\n\nit's worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him,\n\nbut when you do, they're usually right.Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write\n\na bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again.\n\nOften you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes\n\na whole essay.You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can\n\nensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the\n\nones that aren't.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered\n\nbad. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results,\n\nyou're supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay\n\nwriting, publication bias is the way to go.My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an\n\nessay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting\n\nit very carefully.I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but\n\nI'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing\n\nthem. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that\n\nstick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily\n\nwritten, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The\n\nannoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or\n\nso I'm saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. They become like\n\nbriars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won't\n\npublish an essay till they're all gone  till I can read through\n\nthe whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't\n\nthink of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through\n\none that doesn't seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence\n\ndoesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and\n\nyou've usually got the replacement right there in your head.This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You\n\ndon't have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you\n\nneed to get it right. You don't have to publish the essay at all,\n\nif you can't get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the\n\nface of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that's what it feels\n\nlike. What's really going on is that you have different expectations\n\nfor yourself. You're like a parent saying to a child \"we can sit\n\nhere all night till you eat your vegetables.\" Except you're the\n\nchild too.I'm not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition\n\n(c) in \"A Way to Detect Bias\"\n\nafter readers pointed out that I'd\n\nomitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There's a trick for getting importance too. It's like the trick I\n\nsuggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something\n\nyou yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader.\n\nThe reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about\n\ntopics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important\n\nto a significant number of readers as well.Importance has two factors. It's the number of people something\n\nmatters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course\n\nthat it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann\n\nsum.The way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about\n\na lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this\n\ndepartment too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've\n\nthought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a\n\nsignificant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and\n\nimportance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you\n\nwill. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't\n\npublish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the\n\nnovelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of\n\nit. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in\n\nthis case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble.\n\nIf you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit\n\nwhen you learn something you didn't know, because you can be confident\n\nthat most other people wouldn't know it either.The fourth component of useful writing, strength, comes from two\n\nthings: thinking well, and the skillful use of qualification. These\n\ntwo counterbalance each other, like the accelerator and clutch in\n\na car with a manual transmission. As you try to refine the expression\n\nof an idea, you adjust the qualification accordingly. Something\n\nyou're sure of, you can state baldly with no qualification at all,\n\nas I did the four components of useful writing. Whereas points that\n\nseem dubious have to be held at arm's length with perhapses.As you refine an idea, you're pushing in the direction of less\n\nqualification. But you can rarely get it down to zero. Sometimes\n\nyou don't even want to, if it's a side point and a fully refined\n\nversion would be too long.Some say that qualifications weaken writing. For example, that you\n\nshould never begin a sentence in an essay with \"I think,\" because\n\nif you're saying it, then of course you think it. And it's true\n\nthat \"I think x\" is a weaker statement than simply \"x.\" Which is\n\nexactly why you need \"I think.\" You need it to express your degree\n\nof certainty.But qualifications are not scalars. They're not just experimental\n\nerror. There must be 50 things they can express: how broadly something\n\napplies, how you know it, how happy you are it's so, even how it\n\ncould be falsified. I'm not going to try to explore the structure\n\nof qualification here. It's probably more complex than the whole\n\ntopic of writing usefully. Instead I'll just give you a practical\n\ntip: Don't underestimate qualification. It's an important skill in\n\nits own right, not just a sort of tax you have to pay in order to\n\navoid saying things that are false. So learn and use its full range.\n\nIt may not be fully half of having good ideas, but it's part of\n\nhaving them.There's one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as\n\nsimply as possible. But I don't think this is a component of\n\nusefulness. It's more a matter of consideration for the reader. And\n\nit's a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more\n\nobvious when expressed in simple language. But I'll admit that the\n\nmain reason I write simply is not for the reader's sake or because\n\nit helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more\n\nor fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program\n\nthat's too long.I realize florid writing works for some people. But unless you're\n\nsure you're one of them, the best advice is to write as simply as\n\nyou can._____\n\nI believe the formula I've given you, importance + novelty +\n\ncorrectness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay. But I should\n\nwarn you that it's also a recipe for making people mad.The root of the problem is novelty. When you tell people something\n\nthey didn't know, they don't always thank you for it. Sometimes the\n\nreason people don't know something is because they don't want to\n\nknow it. Usually because it contradicts some cherished belief. And\n\nindeed, if you're looking for novel ideas, popular but mistaken\n\nbeliefs are a good place to find them. Every popular mistaken belief\n\ncreates a dead zone of ideas around\n\nit that are relatively unexplored because they contradict it.The strength component just makes things worse. If there's anything\n\nthat annoys people more than having their cherished assumptions\n\ncontradicted, it's having them flatly contradicted.Plus if you've used the Morris technique, your writing will seem\n\nquite confident. Perhaps offensively confident, to people who\n\ndisagree with you. The reason you'll seem confident is that you are\n\nconfident: you've cheated, by only publishing the things you're\n\nsure of.  It will seem to people who try to disagree with you that\n\nyou never admit you're wrong. In fact you constantly admit you're\n\nwrong. You just do it before publishing instead of after.And if your writing is as simple as possible, that just makes things\n\nworse. Brevity is the diction of command. If you watch someone\n\ndelivering unwelcome news from a position of inferiority, you'll\n\nnotice they tend to use lots of words, to soften the blow. Whereas\n\nto be short with someone is more or less to be rude to them.It can sometimes work to deliberately phrase statements more weakly\n\nthan you mean. To put \"perhaps\" in front of something you're actually\n\nquite sure of. But you'll notice that when writers do this, they\n\nusually do it with a wink.I don't like to do this too much. It's cheesy to adopt an ironic\n\ntone for a whole essay. I think we just have to face the fact that\n\nelegance and curtness are two names for the same thing.You might think that if you work sufficiently hard to ensure that\n\nan essay is correct, it will be invulnerable to attack. That's sort\n\nof true. It will be invulnerable to valid attacks. But in practice\n\nthat's little consolation.In fact, the strength component of useful writing will make you\n\nparticularly vulnerable to misrepresentation. If you've stated an\n\nidea as strongly as you could without making it false, all anyone\n\nhas to do is to exaggerate slightly what you said, and now it is\n\nfalse.Much of the time they're not even doing it deliberately. One of the\n\nmost surprising things you'll discover, if you start writing essays,\n\nis that people who disagree with you rarely disagree with what\n\nyou've actually written. Instead they make up something you said\n\nand disagree with that.For what it's worth, the countermove is to ask someone who does\n\nthis to quote a specific sentence or passage you wrote that they\n\nbelieve is false, and explain why. I say \"for what it's worth\"\n\nbecause they never do. So although it might seem that this could\n\nget a broken discussion back on track, the truth is that it was\n\nnever on track in the first place.Should you explicitly forestall likely misinterpretations? Yes, if\n\nthey're misinterpretations a reasonably smart and well-intentioned\n\nperson might make. In fact it's sometimes better to say something\n\nslightly misleading and then add the correction than to try to get\n\nan idea right in one shot. That can be more efficient, and can also\n\nmodel the way such an idea would be discovered.But I don't think you should explicitly forestall intentional\n\nmisinterpretations in the body of an essay. An essay is a place to\n\nmeet honest readers. You don't want to spoil your house by putting\n\nbars on the windows to protect against dishonest ones. The place\n\nto protect against intentional misinterpretations is in end-notes.\n\nBut don't think you can predict them all. People are as ingenious\n\nat misrepresenting you when you say something they don't want to\n\nhear as they are at coming up with rationalizations for things they\n\nwant to do but know they shouldn't. I suspect it's the same skill._____\n\nAs with most other things, the way to get better at writing essays\n\nis to practice. But how do you start? Now that we've examined the\n\nstructure of useful writing, we can rephrase that question more\n\nprecisely. Which constraint do you relax initially? The answer is,\n\nthe first component of importance: the number of people who care\n\nabout what you write.If you narrow the topic sufficiently, you can probably find something\n\nyou're an expert on. Write about that to start with. If you only\n\nhave ten readers who care, that's fine. You're helping them, and\n\nyou're writing. Later you can expand the breadth of topics you write\n\nabout.The other constraint you can relax is a little surprising: publication.\n\nWriting essays doesn't have to mean publishing them. That may seem\n\nstrange now that the trend is to publish every random thought, but\n\nit worked for me. I wrote what amounted to essays in notebooks for\n\nabout 15 years. I never published any of them and never expected\n\nto. I wrote them as a way of figuring things out. But when the web\n\ncame along I'd had a lot of practice.Incidentally,\n\nSteve\n\nWozniak did the same thing. In high school he\n\ndesigned computers on paper for fun. He couldn't build them because\n\nhe couldn't afford the components. But when Intel launched 4K DRAMs\n\nin 1975, he was ready._____\n\nHow many essays are there left to write though? The answer to that\n\nquestion is probably the most exciting thing I've learned about\n\nessay writing. Nearly all of them are left to write.Although the essay\n\nis an old form, it hasn't been assiduously\n\ncultivated. In the print era, publication was expensive, and there\n\nwasn't enough demand for essays to publish that many. You could\n\npublish essays if you were already well known for writing something\n\nelse, like novels. Or you could write book reviews that you took\n\nover to express your own ideas. But there was not really a direct\n\npath to becoming an essayist. Which meant few essays got written,\n\nand those that did tended to be about a narrow range of subjects.Now, thanks to the internet, there's a path. Anyone can publish\n\nessays online. You start in obscurity, perhaps, but at least you\n\ncan start. You don't need anyone's permission.It sometimes happens that an area of knowledge sits quietly for\n\nyears, till some change makes it explode. Cryptography did this to\n\nnumber theory. The internet is doing it to the essay.The exciting thing is not that there's a lot left to write, but\n\nthat there's a lot left to discover. There's a certain kind of idea\n\nthat's best discovered by writing essays. If most essays are still\n\nunwritten, most such ideas are still undiscovered.Notes[1] Put railings on the balconies, but don't put bars on the windows.[2] Even now I sometimes write essays that are not meant for\n\npublication. I wrote several to figure out what Y Combinator should\n\ndo, and they were really helpful.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, and\n\nRobert Morris for reading drafts of this.Spanish TranslationJapanese Translation", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 2815, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:46.280159Z"}

It seems like I'm always talking to\n\nsome startup working in a new field I know nothing about, or reading\n\na book about a topic I don't understand well enough, or visiting some new\n\ncountry where I don't know how things work.It's not pleasant to feel like a noob. And the word \"noob\" is\n\ncertainly not a compliment. And yet today I realized something\n\nencouraging about being a noob: the more of a noob you are locally,\n\nthe less of a noob you are globally.For example, if you stay in your home country, you'll feel less\n\nof a noob than if you move to Farawavia, where everything works\n\ndifferently. And yet you'll know more if you move.\n\nSo the feeling of being a noob is inversely correlated with actual\n\nignorance.But if the feeling of being a noob is good for us, why do we dislike\n\nit? What evolutionary purpose could such an aversion serve?I think the answer is that there are two sources of feeling like a\n\nnoob: being stupid, and doing something novel. Our dislike of feeling\n\nlike a noob is our brain telling us \"Come on, come on, figure this\n\nout.\" Which was the right thing to be thinking for most of human\n\nhistory. The life of hunter-gatherers was complex, but it didn't\n\nchange as much as life does now. They didn't suddenly have to figure\n\nout what to do about cryptocurrency. So it made sense to be biased\n\ntoward competence at existing problems over the discovery of new\n\nones. It made sense for humans to dislike the feeling of being a\n\nnoob, just as, in a world where food was scarce, it made sense for\n\nthem to dislike the feeling of being hungry.Now that too much food is more of a problem than too little, our\n\ndislike of feeling hungry leads us astray.

{"id": "fh", "title": "Haters", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/fh.html", "date": "2020-01", "content": "January 2020(I originally intended this for startup founders, who are often\n\nsurprised by the attention they get as their companies grow, but\n\nit applies equally to anyone who becomes famous.)If you become sufficiently famous, you'll acquire some fans who\n\nlike you too much. These people are sometimes called \"fanboys,\" and\n\nthough I dislike that term, I'm going to have to use it here.  We\n\nneed some word for them, because this is a distinct phenomenon from\n\nsomeone simply liking your work.A fanboy is obsessive and uncritical. Liking you becomes part of\n\ntheir identity, and they create an image of you in their own head\n\nthat is much better than reality. Everything you do is good, because\n\nyou do it. If you do something bad, they find a way to see it as\n\ngood. And their love for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one.\n\nThey want everyone to know how great you are.Well, you may be thinking, I could do without this kind of obsessive\n\nfan, but I know there are all kinds of people in the world, and if\n\nthis is the worst consequence of fame, that's not so bad.Unfortunately this is not the worst consequence of fame. As well\n\nas fanboys, you'll have haters.A hater is obsessive and uncritical. Disliking you becomes part of\n\ntheir identity, and they create an image of you in their own head\n\nthat is much worse than reality. Everything you do is bad, because\n\nyou do it. If you do something good, they find a way to see it as\n\nbad. And their dislike for you is not, usually, a quiet, private\n\none. They want everyone to know how awful you are.If you're thinking of checking, I'll save you the trouble. The\n\nsecond and fifth paragraphs are identical except for \"good\" being\n\nswitched to \"bad\" and so on.I spent years puzzling about haters.  What are they, and where do\n\nthey come from? Then one day it dawned on me. Haters are just fanboys\n\nwith the sign switched.Note that by haters, I don't simply mean trolls. I'm not talking about\n\npeople who say bad things about you and then move on. I'm talking\n\nabout the much smaller group of people for whom this becomes a\n\nkind of obsession and who do it repeatedly over a long period.Like fans, haters seem to be an automatic consequence of fame.\n\nAnyone sufficiently famous will have them. And like fans, haters\n\nare energized by the fame of whoever they hate. They hear a song\n\nby some pop singer. They don't like it much. If the singer were an\n\nobscure one, they'd just forget about it. But instead they keep\n\nhearing her name, and this seems to drive some people crazy.\n\nEveryone's always going on about this singer, but she's no good!\n\nShe's a fraud!That word \"fraud\" is an important one. It's the spectral signature\n\nof a hater to regard the object of their hatred as a\n\nfraud. They\n\ncan't deny their fame. Indeed, their fame is if anything exaggerated\n\nin the hater's mind. They notice every mention of the singer's name,\n\nbecause every mention makes them angrier. In their own minds they\n\nexaggerate both the singer's fame and her lack of talent, and the\n\nonly way to reconcile those two ideas is to conclude that she has\n\ntricked everyone.What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I'm not\n\nsure about this, but I've noticed some patterns. Haters are generally\n\nlosers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionally\n\ntalented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyone\n\nsuccessful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikely\n\nto regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, because\n\nanyone famous knows how random fame is.But haters are not always complete losers. They are not always the\n\nproverbial guy living in his mom's basement. Many are, but some\n\nhave some amount of talent. In fact I suspect that a sense of\n\nfrustrated talent is what drives some people to become haters.\n\nThey're not just saying \"It's unfair that so-and-so is famous,\" but\n\n\"It's unfair that so-and-so is famous, and not me.\"Could a hater be cured if they achieved something impressive? My\n\nguess is that's a moot point, because they\n\nnever will. I've been\n\nable to observe for long enough that I'm fairly confident the pattern\n\nworks both ways: not only do people who do great work never become\n\nhaters, haters never do great work. Although I dislike the word\n\n\"fanboy,\" it's evocative of something important about both haters\n\nand fanboys. It implies that the fanboy is so slavishly predictable in his admiration\n\nthat he's diminished as a result, that he's less than a man.Haters seem even more diminished. I can imagine being a fanboy.\n\nI can think of people whose work I admire so much that I could abase\n\nmyself before them out of sheer gratitude. If P. G.  Wodehouse were\n\nstill alive, I could see myself being a Wodehouse fanboy. But I\n\ncould not imagine being a hater.Knowing that haters are just fanboys with the sign bit flipped makes\n\nit much easier to deal with them. We don't need a separate theory\n\nof haters. We can just use existing techniques for dealing with\n\nobsessive fans.The most important of which is simply not to think much about them.\n\nIf you're like most people who become famous enough to acquire\n\nhaters, your initial reaction will be one of mystification. Why\n\ndoes this guy seem to have it in for me? Where does his obsessive\n\nenergy come from, and what makes him so appallingly nasty? What did\n\nI do to set him off? Is it something I can fix?The mistake here is to think of the hater as someone you have a\n\ndispute with. When you have a dispute with someone, it's usually a\n\ngood idea to try to understand why they're upset and then fix things\n\nif you can. Disputes are distracting. But it's a false analogy to\n\nthink of a hater as someone you have a dispute with.  It's an\n\nunderstandable mistake, if you've never encountered haters before.\n\nBut when you realize that you're dealing with a hater, and what a\n\nhater is, it's clear that it's a waste of time even to think about\n\nthem. If you have obsessive fans, do you spend any time wondering\n\nwhat makes them love you so much? No, you just think \"some\n\npeople are kind of crazy,\" and that's the end of it.Since haters are equivalent to fanboys, that's the way to deal with\n\nthem too. There may have been something that set them off. But it's\n\nnot something that would have set off a normal person, so there's\n\nno reason to spend any time thinking about it. It's not you, it's\n\nthem.Notes[1] There are of course some people who are genuine frauds. How can\n\nyou distinguish between x calling y a fraud because x is a hater,\n\nand because y is a fraud? Look at neutral opinion. Actual frauds\n\nare usually pretty conspicuous. Thoughtful people are rarely taken\n\nin by them. So if there are some thoughtful people who like y, you\n\ncan usually assume y is not a fraud.[2] I would make an exception for teenagers, who sometimes act in\n\nsuch extreme ways that they are literally not themselves. I can\n\nimagine a teenage kid being a hater and then growing out of it. But\n\nnot anyone over 25.[3] I have a much worse memory for misdeeds than my wife Jessica,\n\nwho is a connoisseur of character, but I don't wish it were better.\n\nMost disputes are a waste of time even if you're in the right, and\n\nit's easy to bury the hatchet with someone if you can't remember\n\nwhy you were mad at them.[4] A competent hater will not merely attack you individually but\n\nwill try to get mobs after you. In some cases you may want to refute\n\nwhatever bogus claim they made in order to do so.

{"id": "mod", "title": "The Two Kinds of Moderate", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/mod.html", "date": null, "content": "December 2019There are two distinct ways to be politically moderate: on purpose\n\nand by accident. Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately\n\nchoosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left.\n\nAccidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they\n\nmake up their own minds about each question, and the far right and\n\nfar left are roughly equally wrong.You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the\n\ndistribution of their opinions. If the far left opinion on some\n\nmatter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate's\n\nopinion on every question will be near 50. Whereas an accidental\n\nmoderate's opinions will be scattered over a broad range, but will,\n\nlike those of the intentional moderate, average to about 50.Intentional moderates are similar to those on the far left and the\n\nfar right in that their opinions are, in a sense, not their own.\n\nThe defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the\n\nright, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. You don't get to pick\n\nand choose. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from your\n\nopinions about sex. And although intentional moderates\n\nmight seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though\n\nin their case the word \"positions\" might be more accurate) are also\n\nacquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left,\n\nthe intentional moderate must shift with it. Otherwise they stop\n\nbeing moderate.Accidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their own\n\nanswers, but choose their own questions. They may not care at all\n\nabout questions that the left and right both think are terribly\n\nimportant. So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental\n\nmoderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and\n\nthose the left and right care about, and this can\n\nsometimes be vanishingly small.It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say \"if you're\n\nnot with us, you're against us,\" but often simply false.Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by\n\nthe extreme left. But while it may be accurate to call intentional\n\nmoderates cowards, openly being an accidental moderate requires the\n\nmost courage of all, because you get attacked from both right and\n\nleft, and you don't have the comfort of being an orthodox member\n\nof a large group to sustain you.Nearly all the most impressive people I know are accidental moderates.\n\nIf I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainment\n\nbusiness, that might be different. Being on the far left or far\n\nright doesn't affect how fast you run or how well you sing. But\n\nsomeone who works with ideas has to be independent-minded to do it\n\nwell.Or more precisely, you have to be independent-minded about the ideas\n\nyou work with. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics\n\nand still be a good mathematician. In the 20th century, a lot of\n\nvery smart people were Marxists  just no one who was smart about\n\nthe subjects Marxism involves. But if the ideas you use in your\n\nwork intersect with the politics of your time, you have two choices:\n\nbe an accidental moderate, or be mediocre.Notes[1] It's possible in theory for one side to be entirely right and\n\nthe other to be entirely wrong. Indeed, ideologues must always\n\nbelieve this is the case. But historically it rarely has been.[2] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather\n\nthan despise them as backsliders. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it\n\nmeans that the far right is less ideological than the far left. Or\n\nperhaps that they are more confident, or more resigned, or simply\n\nmore disorganized. I just don't know.[3] Having heretical opinions doesn't mean you have to express\n\nthem openly.

{"id": "kids", "title": "Having Kids", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/kids.html", "date": null, "content": "December 2019Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I\n\nfelt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living\n\nvirtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children.\n\nBut did I want them now? No.If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since\n\nI was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had\n\nno fun.  And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that,\n\nto be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind.\n\nWhenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be\n\nterrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they\n\nprevailed.When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically,\n\nbecause that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at\n\nall.  \"Better you than me,\" I was thinking.Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and\n\nI mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded\n\nturned out to be wonderful.Partly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical\n\nchanges that happened almost instantly when our first child was\n\nborn.  It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt\n\nprotective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was\n\ndriving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a\n\ncrosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking \"I have\n\nto be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is\n\nsomeone's child!\"So to some extent you can't trust me when I say having kids is\n\ngreat.  To some extent I'm like a religious cultist telling you\n\nthat you'll be happy if you join the cult too  but only because\n\njoining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you\n\nhappy to be a cult member.But not entirely. There were some things\n\nabout having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my\n\nobservations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed\n\nthat I wrote \"Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids.\" Of course\n\nthe times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only\n\nnoticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed\n\nthem?  Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only\n\ntimes I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes.\n\nWhich is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler\n\nis something very few parents enjoy.What I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were\n\nall the great moments parents had with kids. People don't talk about\n\nthese much  the magic is hard to put into words, and all other\n\nparents know about them anyway  but one of the great things about\n\nhaving kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is\n\nnowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be\n\ndoing.  You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just\n\nbe going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing\n\nthem on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments\n\nfor anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but\n\nthat's what you feel.  You don't need to look any\n\nfurther than where you are right now.Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they\n\nwere rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that\n\nwas similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble\n\nfor something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was\n\nessentially law enforcement.  I didn't realize there were good times\n\ntoo.I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd\n\nreally enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this\n\nwoman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected\n\nher to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling\n\nthe truth.She said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been\n\ninteresting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids.\n\nYou don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're\n\nreally interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously\n\nfond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty\n\ntimes) it's often genuinely fun to play with them.  That surprised\n\nme too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely\n\nnot fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it\n\ndoes.There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still,\n\nterror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience\n\nthat are hard to imagine unless you've had them. But it is not, as I\n\nimplicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for\n\nthe lifeboats.Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They\n\ndefinitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some\n\npeople get their act together, but if your act was already together,\n\nyou're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're\n\ngoing to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules.  I'm not\n\nsure if it's because that's how kids are, or because it's the only\n\nway to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids,\n\nyou tend to have to work on their schedule.You will have chunks of time to work. But you can't let work spill\n\npromiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had\n\nkids. You're going to have to work at the same time every day,\n\nwhether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be\n\ntimes when you have to stop, even if it is.I've been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds\n\na way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens\n\nat those times. So while I don't get as much done as before I had\n\nkids, I get enough done.I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part\n\nof my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It\n\nhurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But\n\nif there weren't something real there, why would I squirm?  The\n\nfact is, once you have kids, you're probably going to care more\n\nabout them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum\n\ngame. Only one idea at a time can be the\n\ntop idea in your mind.\n\nOnce you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it\n\nwill less often be some project you're working on.I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when\n\nI write essays, I think about what I'd want my kids to know. That\n\ndrives me to get things right. And when I was writing\n\nBel, I told\n\nmy kids that once I finished it I'd take them to Africa. When you\n\nsay that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise.\n\nWhich meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to\n\nAfrica.  Maybe if I'm really lucky such tricks could put me net\n\nahead. But the wind is there, no question.On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it\n\nwon't survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn't\n\noverwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like\n\nbefore. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the\n\nability to take off for some other country at a moment's notice.\n\nThat was so great. Why did I never do that?See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before\n\nkids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used\n\nit.I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up\n\nhappy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments,\n\nthere are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it\n\non tap, almost any bedtime.People's experiences as parents\n\nvary a lot, and I know I've been lucky. But I think the worries I\n\nhad before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other\n\nparents' faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that\n\nkids bring.\n\nNote[1] Adults are sophisticated enough to see 2 year olds for the\n\nfascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 year\n\nolds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris\n\nfor reading drafts of this.Arabic TranslationSlovak Translation", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1512, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:49.243338Z"}
{"id": "lesson", "title": "The Lesson to Unlearn", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html", "date": "2019-12", "content": "The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you\n\nlearned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student\n\nonce told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only\n\nwhat he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the\n\nonly time I ever heard anyone say such a thing.For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learning\n\ncompletely dominated actual learning in college.  I was fairly\n\nearnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took,\n\nand I worked hard. And yet I worked by far the hardest when I was\n\nstudying for a test.In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of what\n\nyou've learned in the class. In theory you shouldn't have to prepare\n\nfor a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a blood\n\ntest. In theory you learn from taking the class, from going to the\n\nlectures and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the test\n\nthat comes afterward merely measures how well you learned.In practice, as almost everyone reading this will know, things are\n\nso different that hearing this explanation of how classes and tests\n\nare meant to work is like hearing the etymology of a word whose\n\nmeaning has changed completely. In practice, the phrase \"studying\n\nfor a test\" was almost redundant, because that was when one really\n\nstudied.  The difference between diligent and slack students was\n\nthat the former studied hard for tests and the latter didn't.  No\n\none was pulling all-nighters two weeks into the semester.Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did in\n\nschool was aimed at getting a good grade on something.To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentence\n\nhas a \"though\" in it. Aren't I merely stating a tautology? Isn't\n\nthat what a diligent student is, a straight-A student? That's how\n\ndeeply the conflation of learning with grades has infused our\n\nculture.Is it so bad if learning is conflated with grades?  Yes, it is bad.\n\nAnd it wasn't till decades after college, when I was running Y Combinator, that I realized how bad it is.I knew of course when I was a student that studying for a test is\n\nfar from identical with actual learning. At the very least, you\n\ndon't retain knowledge you cram into your head the night before an\n\nexam. But the problem is worse than that. The real problem is that\n\nmost tests don't come close to measuring what they're supposed to.If tests truly were tests of learning, things wouldn't be so bad.\n\nGetting good grades and learning would converge, just a little late.\n\nThe problem is that nearly all tests given to students are terribly\n\nhackable. Most people who've gotten good grades know this, and know\n\nit so well they've ceased even to question it.  You'll see when you\n\nrealize how naive it sounds to act otherwise.Suppose you're taking a class on medieval history and the final\n\nexam is coming up. The final exam is supposed to be a test of your\n\nknowledge of medieval history, right? So if you have a couple days\n\nbetween now and the exam, surely the best way to spend the time,\n\nif you want to do well on the exam, is to read the best books you\n\ncan find about medieval history. Then you'll know a lot about it,\n\nand do well on the exam.No, no, no, experienced students are saying to themselves.  If you\n\nmerely read good books on medieval history, most of the stuff you\n\nlearned wouldn't be on the test.  It's not good books you want to\n\nread, but the lecture notes and assigned reading in this class.\n\nAnd even most of that you can ignore, because you only have to worry\n\nabout the sort of thing that could turn up as a test question.\n\nYou're looking for sharply-defined chunks of information. If one\n\nof the assigned readings has an interesting digression on some\n\nsubtle point, you can safely ignore that, because it's not the sort\n\nof thing that could be turned into a test question.  But if the\n\nprofessor tells you that there were three underlying causes of the\n\nSchism of 1378, or three main consequences of the Black Death, you'd\n\nbetter know them. And whether they were in fact the causes or\n\nconsequences is beside the point.  For the purposes of this class\n\nthey are.At a university there are often copies of old exams floating around,\n\nand these narrow still further what you have to learn. As well as\n\nlearning what kind of questions this professor asks, you'll often\n\nget actual exam questions. Many professors re-use them.  After\n\nteaching a class for 10 years, it would be hard not to, at least\n\ninadvertently.In some classes, your professor will have had some sort of political\n\naxe to grind, and if so you'll have to grind it too. The need for\n\nthis varies. In classes in math or the hard sciences or engineering\n\nit's rarely necessary, but at the other end of the spectrum there\n\nare classes where you couldn't get a good grade without it.Getting a good grade in a class on x is so different from learning\n\na lot about x that you have to choose one or the other, and you\n\ncan't blame students if they choose grades.  Everyone judges them\n\nby their grades  graduate programs, employers, scholarships, even\n\ntheir own parents.I liked learning, and I really enjoyed some of the papers and\n\nprograms I wrote in college. But did I ever, after turning in a\n\npaper in some class, sit down and write another just for fun? Of\n\ncourse not. I had things due in other classes. If it ever came to\n\na choice of learning or grades, I chose grades. I hadn't come to\n\ncollege to do badly.Anyone who cares about getting good grades has to play this game,\n\nor they'll be surpassed by those who do. And at elite universities,\n\nthat means nearly everyone, since someone who didn't care about\n\ngetting good grades probably wouldn't be there in the first place.\n\nThe result is that students compete to maximize the difference\n\nbetween learning and getting good grades.Why are tests so bad? More precisely, why are they so hackable?\n\nAny experienced programmer could answer that. How hackable is\n\nsoftware whose author hasn't paid any attention to preventing it\n\nfrom being hacked? Usually it's as porous as a colander.Hackable is the default for any test imposed by an authority. The\n\nreason the tests you're given are so consistently bad  so consistently\n\nfar from measuring what they're supposed to measure  is simply\n\nthat the people creating them haven't made much effort to prevent\n\nthem from being hacked.But you can't blame teachers if their tests are hackable. Their job\n\nis to teach, not to create unhackable tests. The real problem is\n\ngrades, or more precisely, that grades have been overloaded. If\n\ngrades were merely a way for teachers to tell students what they\n\nwere doing right and wrong, like a coach giving advice to an athlete,\n\nstudents wouldn't be tempted to hack tests. But unfortunately after\n\na certain age grades become more than advice. After a certain age,\n\nwhenever you're being taught, you're usually also being judged.I've used college tests as an example, but those are actually the\n\nleast hackable. All the tests most students take their whole lives\n\nare at least as bad, including, most spectacularly of all, the test\n\nthat gets them into college. If getting into college were merely a\n\nmatter of having the quality of one's mind measured by admissions\n\nofficers the way scientists measure the mass of an object, we could\n\ntell teenage kids \"learn a lot\" and leave it at that.  You can tell\n\nhow bad college admissions are, as a test, from how unlike high\n\nschool that sounds. In practice, the freakishly specific nature of\n\nthe stuff ambitious kids have to do in high school is directly\n\nproportionate to the hackability of college admissions.  The classes\n\nyou don't care about that are mostly memorization, the random\n\n\"extracurricular activities\" you have to participate in to show\n\nyou're \"well-rounded,\" the standardized tests as artificial as\n\nchess, the \"essay\" you have to write that's presumably meant to hit\n\nsome very specific target, but you're not told what.As well as being bad in what it does to kids, this test is also bad\n\nin the sense of being very hackable. So hackable that whole industries\n\nhave grown up to hack it. This is the explicit purpose of test-prep\n\ncompanies and admissions counsellors, but it's also a significant\n\npart of the function of private schools.Why is this particular test so hackable? I think because of what\n\nit's measuring. Although the popular story is that the way to get\n\ninto a good college is to be really smart, admissions officers at\n\nelite colleges neither are, nor claim to be, looking only for that.\n\nWhat are they looking for?  They're looking for people who are not\n\nsimply smart, but admirable in some more general sense.  And how\n\nis this more general admirableness measured?  The admissions officers\n\nfeel it. In other words, they accept who they like.So what college admissions is a test of is whether you suit the\n\ntaste of some group of people. Well, of course a test like that is\n\ngoing to be hackable. And because it's both very hackable and there's\n\n(thought to be) a lot at stake, it's hacked like nothing else.\n\nThat's why it distorts your life so much for so long.It's no wonder high school students often feel alienated. The shape\n\nof their lives is completely artificial.But wasting your time is not the worst thing the educational system\n\ndoes to you. The worst thing it does is to train you that the way\n\nto win is by hacking bad tests.  This is a much subtler problem\n\nthat I didn't recognize until I saw it happening to other people.When I started advising startup founders at Y Combinator, especially\n\nyoung ones, I was puzzled by the way they always seemed to make\n\nthings overcomplicated. How, they would ask, do you raise money?\n\nWhat's the trick for making venture capitalists want to invest in\n\nyou? The best way to make VCs want to invest in you, I would explain,\n\nis to actually be a good investment. Even if you could trick VCs\n\ninto investing in a bad startup, you'd be tricking yourselves too.\n\nYou're investing time in the same company you're asking them to\n\ninvest money in. If it's not a good investment, why are you even\n\ndoing it?Oh, they'd say, and then after a pause to digest this revelation,\n\nthey'd ask: What makes a startup a good investment?So I would explain that what makes a startup promising, not just\n\nin the eyes of investors but in fact, is\n\ngrowth.\n\nIdeally in revenue,\n\nbut failing that in usage. What they needed to do was get lots of\n\nusers.How does one get lots of users? They had all kinds of ideas about\n\nthat. They needed to do a big launch that would get them \"exposure.\"\n\nThey needed influential people to talk about them. They even knew\n\nthey needed to launch on a tuesday, because that's when one gets\n\nthe most attention.No, I would explain, that is not how to get lots of users. The way\n\nyou get lots of users is to make the product really great. Then\n\npeople will not only use it but recommend it to their friends, so\n\nyour growth will be exponential once you\n\nget it started.At this point I've told the founders something you'd think would\n\nbe completely obvious: that they should make a good company by\n\nmaking a good product. And yet their reaction would be something\n\nlike the reaction many physicists must have had when they first\n\nheard about the theory of relativity: a mixture of astonishment at\n\nits apparent genius, combined with a suspicion that anything so\n\nweird couldn't possibly be right. Ok, they would say, dutifully.\n\nAnd could you introduce us to such-and-such influential person? And\n\nremember, we want to launch on Tuesday.It would sometimes take founders years to grasp these simple lessons.\n\nAnd not because they were lazy or stupid. They just seemed blind\n\nto what was right in front of them.Why, I would ask myself, do they always make things so complicated?\n\nAnd then one day I realized this was not a rhetorical question.Why did founders tie themselves in knots doing the wrong things\n\nwhen the answer was right in front of them? Because that was what\n\nthey'd been trained to do. Their education had taught them that the\n\nway to win was to hack the test. And without even telling them they\n\nwere being trained to do this. The younger ones, the recent graduates,\n\nhad never faced a non-artificial test. They thought this was just\n\nhow the world worked: that the first thing you did, when facing any\n\nkind of challenge, was to figure out what the trick was for hacking\n\nthe test. That's why the conversation would always start with how\n\nto raise money, because that read as the test. It came at the end\n\nof YC. It had numbers attached to it, and higher numbers seemed to\n\nbe better. It must be the test.There are certainly big chunks of the world where the way to win\n\nis to hack the test. This phenomenon isn't limited to schools.  And\n\nsome people, either due to ideology or ignorance, claim that this\n\nis true of startups too. But it isn't. In fact, one of the most\n\nstriking things about startups is the degree to which you win by\n\nsimply doing good work. There are edge cases, as there are in\n\nanything, but in general you win by getting users, and what users\n\ncare about is whether the product does what they want.Why did it take me so long to understand why founders made startups\n\novercomplicated? Because I hadn't realized explicitly that schools\n\ntrain us to win by hacking bad tests. And not just them, but me!\n\nI'd been trained to hack bad tests too, and hadn't realized it till\n\ndecades later.I had lived as if I realized it, but without knowing why. For\n\nexample, I had avoided working for big companies. But if you'd asked\n\nwhy, I'd have said it was because they were bogus, or bureaucratic.\n\nOr just yuck. I never understood how much of my dislike of big\n\ncompanies was due to the fact that you win by hacking bad tests.Similarly, the fact that the tests were unhackable was a lot of\n\nwhat attracted me to startups. But again, I hadn't realized that\n\nexplicitly.I had in effect achieved by successive approximations something\n\nthat may have a closed-form solution.  I had gradually undone my\n\ntraining in hacking bad tests without knowing I was doing it.  Could\n\nsomeone coming out of school banish this demon just by knowing its\n\nname, and saying begone? It seems worth trying.Merely talking explicitly about this phenomenon is likely to make\n\nthings better, because much of its power comes from the fact that\n\nwe take it for granted. After you've noticed it, it seems the\n\nelephant in the room, but it's a pretty well camouflaged elephant.\n\nThe phenomenon is so old, and so pervasive. And it's simply the\n\nresult of neglect. No one meant things to be this way. This is just\n\nwhat happens when you combine learning with grades, competition,\n\nand the naive assumption of unhackability.It was mind-blowing to realize that two of the things I'd puzzled\n\nabout the most  the bogusness of high school, and the difficulty\n\nof getting founders to see the obvious  both had the same cause.\n\nIt's rare for such a big block to slide into place so late.Usually when that happens it has implications in a lot of different\n\nareas, and this case seems no exception. For example, it suggests\n\nboth that education could be done better, and how you might fix it.\n\nBut it also suggests a potential answer to the question all big\n\ncompanies seem to have: how can we be more like a startup? I'm not\n\ngoing to chase down all the implications now. What I want to focus\n\non here is what it means for individuals.To start with, it means that most ambitious kids graduating from\n\ncollege have something they may want to unlearn.  But it also changes\n\nhow you look at the world. Instead of looking at all the different\n\nkinds of work people do and thinking of them vaguely as more or\n\nless appealing, you can now ask a very specific question that will\n\nsort them in an interesting way: to what extent do you win at this\n\nkind of work by hacking bad tests?It would help if there was a way to recognize bad tests quickly.\n\nIs there a pattern here? It turns out there is.Tests can be divided into two kinds: those that are imposed by\n\nauthorities, and those that aren't.  Tests that aren't imposed by\n\nauthorities are inherently unhackable, in the sense that no one is\n\nclaiming they're tests of anything more than they actually test. A\n\nfootball match, for example, is simply a test of who wins, not which\n\nteam is better. You can tell that from the fact that commentators\n\nsometimes say afterward that the better team won. Whereas tests\n\nimposed by authorities are usually proxies for something else. A\n\ntest in a class is supposed to measure not just how well you did\n\non that particular test, but how much you learned in the class.\n\nWhile tests that aren't imposed by authorities are inherently\n\nunhackable, those imposed by authorities have to be made unhackable.\n\nUsually they aren't.  So as a first approximation, bad tests are\n\nroughly equivalent to tests imposed by authorities.You might actually like to win by hacking bad tests. Presumably\n\nsome people do. But I bet most people who find themselves doing\n\nthis kind of work don't like it. They just take it for granted that\n\nthis is how the world works, unless you want to drop out and be\n\nsome kind of hippie artisan.I suspect many people implicitly assume that working in a\n\nfield with bad tests is the price of making lots of money. But that,\n\nI can tell you, is false. It used to be true. In the mid-twentieth\n\ncentury, when the economy was\n\ncomposed of oligopolies,\n\nthe only way\n\nto the top was by playing their game. But it's not true now.  There\n\nare now ways to get rich by doing good work, and that's part of the\n\nreason people are so much more excited about getting rich than they\n\nused to be. When I was a kid, you could either become an engineer\n\nand make cool things, or make lots of money by becoming an \"executive.\"\n\nNow you can make lots of money by making cool things.Hacking bad tests is becoming less important as the link between\n\nwork and authority erodes. The erosion of that link is one of the\n\nmost important trends happening now, and we see its effects in\n\nalmost every kind of work people do. Startups are one of the most\n\nvisible examples, but we see much the same thing in writing. Writers\n\nno longer have to submit to publishers and editors to reach readers;\n\nnow they can go direct.The more I think about this question, the more optimistic I get.\n\nThis seems one of those situations where we don't realize how much\n\nsomething was holding us back until it's eliminated. And I can\n\nforesee the whole bogus edifice crumbling. Imagine what happens as\n\nmore and more people start to ask themselves if they want to win\n\nby hacking bad tests, and decide that they don't.  The kinds of\n\nwork where you win by hacking bad tests will be starved of talent,\n\nand the kinds where you win by doing good work will see an influx\n\nof the most ambitious people. And as hacking bad tests shrinks in\n\nimportance, education will evolve to stop training us to do it.\n\nImagine what the world could look like if that happened.This is not just a lesson for individuals to unlearn, but one for\n\nsociety to unlearn, and we'll be amazed at the energy that's liberated\n\nwhen we do.\n\nNotes[1] If using tests only to measure learning sounds impossibly\n\nutopian, that is already the way things work at Lambda School.\n\nLambda School doesn't have grades. You either graduate or you don't.\n\nThe only purpose of tests is to decide at each stage of the curriculum\n\nwhether you can continue to the next. So in effect the whole school\n\nis pass/fail.[2] If the final exam consisted of a long conversation with the\n\nprofessor, you could prepare for it by reading good books on medieval\n\nhistory. A lot of the hackability of tests in schools is due to the\n\nfact that the same test has to be given to large numbers of students.[3] Learning is the naive algorithm for getting good grades.[4] Hacking has\n\nmultiple senses. There's a narrow sense in which\n\nit means to compromise something. That's the sense in which one\n\nhacks a bad test. But there's another, more general sense, meaning\n\nto find a surprising solution to a problem, often by thinking\n\ndifferently about it. Hacking in this sense is a wonderful thing.\n\nAnd indeed, some of the hacks people use on bad tests are impressively\n\ningenious; the problem is not so much the hacking as that, because\n\nthe tests are hackable, they don't test what they're meant to.[5] The people who pick startups at Y Combinator are similar to\n\nadmissions officers, except that instead of being arbitrary, their\n\nacceptance criteria are trained by a very tight feedback loop. If\n\nyou accept a bad startup or reject a good one, you will usually know it\n\nwithin a year or two at the latest, and often within a month.[6] I'm sure admissions officers are tired of reading applications\n\nfrom kids who seem to have no personality beyond being willing to\n\nseem however they're supposed to seem to get accepted.  What they\n\ndon't realize is that they are, in a sense, looking in a mirror.\n\nThe lack of authenticity in the applicants is a reflection of the\n\narbitrariness of the application process. A dictator might just as\n\nwell complain about the lack of authenticity in the people around\n\nhim.[7] By good work, I don't mean morally good, but good in the sense\n\nin which a good craftsman does good work.[8] There are borderline cases where it's hard to say which category\n\na test falls in. For example, is raising venture capital like college\n\nadmissions, or is it like selling to a customer?[9] Note that a good test is merely one that's unhackable. Good\n\nhere doesn't mean morally good, but good in the sense of working\n\nwell. The difference between fields with bad tests and good ones\n\nis not that the former are bad and the latter are good, but that\n\nthe former are bogus and the latter aren't. But those two measures\n\nare not unrelated.  As Tara Ploughman said, the path from good to\n\nevil goes through bogus.[10] People who think the recent increase in\n\neconomic inequality is\n\ndue to changes in tax policy seem very naive to anyone with experience\n\nin startups. Different people are getting rich now than used to,\n\nand they're getting much richer than mere tax savings could make\n\nthem.[11] Note to tiger parents: you may think you're training your kids\n\nto win, but if you're training them to win by hacking bad tests,\n\nyou are, as parents so often do, training them to fight the last\n\nwar.Thanks to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison,\n\nJessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Harj Taggar for reading\n\ndrafts of this.Russian TranslationArabic TranslationSwedish Translation", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 3982, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:49.846277Z"}

But there's a third ingredient that's not as\n\nwell understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic.To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group\n\nof people, and I'm going to choose bus ticket collectors.  There\n\nare people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, they\n\nhave an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect.\n\nThey can keep track of distinctions between different types of bus\n\ntickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember.  Because\n\nwe don't care enough. What's the point of spending so much time\n\nthinking about old bus tickets?Which leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession:\n\nthere is no point. A bus ticket collector's love is disinterested.\n\nThey're not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, but\n\nfor its own sake.When you look at the lives of people who've done great work, you\n\nsee a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket\n\ncollector's obsessive interest in something that would have seemed\n\npointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most striking\n\nfeatures of Darwin's book about his voyage on the Beagle is the\n\nsheer depth of his interest in natural history. His curiosity seems\n\ninfinite.

There's too much intention in that\n\nmetaphor. Like bus ticket collectors, they were doing it\n\nbecause they liked it.But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket\n\ncollector. Series matter, and bus tickets don't.If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might\n\nbe it: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.Aren't I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you\n\nmight think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for\n\nability and a substitute for determination.  Unless you have\n\nsufficient mathematical aptitude, you won't find series interesting.\n\nAnd when you're obsessively interested in something, you don't need\n\nas much determination: you don't need to push yourself as hard when\n\ncuriosity is pulling you.An obsessive interest will even bring you luck, to the extent\n\nanything can. Chance, as Pasteur said, favors the prepared mind,\n\nand if there's one thing an obsessed mind is, it's prepared.The disinterestedness of this kind of obsession is its most important\n\nfeature. Not just because it's a filter for earnestness, but because\n\nit helps you discover new ideas.The paths that lead to new ideas tend to look unpromising. If they\n\nlooked promising, other people would already have explored them.\n\nHow do the people who do great work discover these paths that others\n\noverlook?  The popular story is that they simply have better vision:\n\nbecause they're so talented, they see paths that others miss.  But\n\nif you look at the way great discoveries are made, that's not what\n\nhappens. Darwin didn't pay closer attention to individual species\n\nthan other people because he saw that this would lead to great\n\ndiscoveries, and they didn't. He was just really, really interested\n\nin such things.Darwin couldn't turn it off. Neither could Ramanujan.  They didn't\n\ndiscover the hidden paths that they did because they seemed promising,\n\nbut because they couldn't help it. That's what allowed them to\n\nfollow paths that someone who was merely ambitious would have\n\nignored.What rational person would decide that the way to write great novels\n\nwas to begin by spending several years creating an imaginary elvish\n\nlanguage, like Tolkien, or visiting every household in southwestern\n\nBritain, like Trollope? No one, including Tolkien and Trollope.The bus ticket theory is similar to Carlyle's famous definition of\n\ngenius as an infinite capacity for taking pains. But there are two\n\ndifferences. The bus ticket theory makes it clear that the source\n\nof this infinite capacity for taking pains is not infinite diligence,\n\nas Carlyle seems to have meant, but the sort of infinite interest\n\nthat collectors have. It also adds an important qualification: an\n\ninfinite capacity for taking pains about something that matters.So what  matters? You can never be sure. It's precisely because no\n\none can tell in advance which paths are promising that you can\n\ndiscover new ideas by working on what you're interested in.But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an\n\nobsession might be one that matters. For example, it's more promising\n\nif you're creating something, rather than just consuming something\n\nsomeone else creates. It's more promising if something you're\n\ninterested in is difficult, especially if it's more difficult for\n\nother people than it is for you. And the obsessions of talented\n\npeople are more likely to be promising. When talented people become\n\ninterested in random things, they're not truly random.But you can never be sure. In fact, here's an interesting idea\n\nthat's also rather alarming if it's true: it may be that to do great\n\nwork, you also have to waste a lot of time.In many different areas, reward is proportionate to risk. If that\n\nrule holds here, then the way to find paths that lead to truly great\n\nwork is to be willing to expend a lot of effort on things that turn\n\nout to be every bit as unpromising as they seem.I'm not sure if this is true. On one hand, it seems surprisingly\n\ndifficult to waste your time so long as you're working hard on\n\nsomething interesting. So much of what you do ends up being useful.\n\nBut on the other hand, the rule about the relationship between risk\n\nand reward is so powerful that it seems to hold wherever risk occurs.\n\nNewton's case, at least, suggests that the risk/reward rule holds\n\nhere. He's famous for one particular obsession of his that turned\n\nout to be unprecedentedly fruitful: using math to describe the\n\nworld. But he had two other obsessions, alchemy and theology, that\n\nseem to have been complete wastes of time. He ended up net ahead.\n\nHis bet on what we now call physics paid off so well that it more\n\nthan compensated for the other two. But were the other two necessary,\n\nin the sense that he had to take big risks to make such big\n\ndiscoveries? I don't know.Here's an even more alarming idea: might one make all bad bets?  It\n\nprobably happens quite often. But we don't know how often, because\n\nthese people don't become famous.It's not merely that the returns from following a path are hard to\n\npredict. They change dramatically over time. 1830 was a really good\n\ntime to be obsessively interested in natural history. If Darwin had\n\nbeen born in 1709 instead of 1809, we might never have heard of\n\nhim.What can one do in the face of such uncertainty?  One solution is\n\nto hedge your bets, which in this case means to follow the obviously\n\npromising paths instead of your own private obsessions. But as with\n\nany hedge, you're decreasing reward when you decrease risk.  If you\n\nforgo working on what you like in order to follow some more\n\nconventionally ambitious path, you might miss something wonderful\n\nthat you'd otherwise have discovered. That too must happen all the\n\ntime, perhaps even more often than the genius whose bets all fail.The other solution is to let yourself be interested in lots of\n\ndifferent things. You don't decrease your upside if you switch\n\nbetween equally genuine interests based on which seems to be working\n\nso far. But there is a danger here too: if you work on too many\n\ndifferent projects, you might not get deeply enough into any of\n\nthem.One interesting thing about the bus ticket theory is that it may\n\nhelp explain why different types of people excel at different kinds\n\nof work. Interest is much more unevenly distributed than ability.\n\nIf natural ability is all you need to do great work, and natural\n\nability is evenly distributed, you have to invent elaborate theories\n\nto explain the skewed distributions we see among those who actually\n\ndo great work in various fields. But it may be that much of the\n\nskew has a simpler explanation: different people are interested in\n\ndifferent things.The bus ticket theory also explains why people are less likely to\n\ndo great work after they have children. Here interest has to compete\n\nnot just with external obstacles, but with another interest, and\n\none that for most people is extremely powerful. It's harder to find\n\ntime for work after you have kids, but that's the easy part. The\n\nreal change is that you don't want to.But the most exciting implication of the bus ticket theory is that\n\nit suggests ways to encourage great work. If the recipe for genius\n\nis simply natural ability plus hard work, all we can do is hope we\n\nhave a lot of ability, and work as hard as we can. But if interest\n\nis a critical ingredient in genius, we may be able, by cultivating\n\ninterest, to cultivate genius.For example, for the very ambitious, the bus ticket theory suggests\n\nthat the way to do great work is to relax a little. Instead of\n\ngritting your teeth and diligently pursuing what all your peers\n\nagree is the most promising line of research, maybe you should try\n\ndoing something just for fun. And if you're stuck, that may be the\n\nvector along which to break out.I've always liked Hamming's famous double-barrelled question: what\n\nare the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you\n\nworking on one of them? It's a great way to shake yourself up. But\n\nit may be overfitting a bit. It might be at least as useful to ask\n\nyourself: if you could take a year off to work on something that\n\nprobably wouldn't be important but would be really interesting,\n\nwhat would it be?The bus ticket theory also suggests a way to avoid slowing down as\n\nyou get older. Perhaps the reason people have fewer new ideas as\n\nthey get older is not simply that they're losing their edge. It may\n\nalso be because once you become established, you can no longer mess\n\nabout with irresponsible side projects the way you could when you\n\nwere young and no one cared what you did.The solution to that is obvious: remain irresponsible. It will be\n\nhard, though, because the apparently random projects you take up\n\nto stave off decline will read to outsiders as evidence of it.  And\n\nyou yourself won't know for sure that they're wrong. But it will\n\nat least be more fun to work on what you want.It may even be that we can cultivate a habit of intellectual bus\n\nticket collecting in kids. The usual plan in education is to start\n\nwith a broad, shallow focus, then gradually become more specialized.\n\nBut I've done the opposite with my kids. I know I can count on their\n\nschool to handle the broad, shallow part, so I take them deep.When they get interested in something, however random, I encourage\n\nthem to go preposterously, bus ticket collectorly, deep.  I don't\n\ndo this because of the bus ticket theory. I do it because I want\n\nthem to feel the joy of learning, and they're never going to feel\n\nthat about something I'm making them learn. It has to be something\n\nthey're interested in. I'm just following the path of least resistance;\n\ndepth is a byproduct. But if in trying to show them the joy of\n\nlearning I also end up training them to go deep, so much the better.Will it have any effect? I have no idea. But that uncertainty may\n\nbe the most interesting point of all. There is so much more to learn\n\nabout how to do great work. As old as human civilization feels,\n\nit's really still very young if we haven't nailed something so\n\nbasic. It's exciting to think there are still discoveries to make\n\nabout discovery. If that's the sort of thing you're interested in.\n\nNotes[1] There are other types of collecting that illustrate this point\n\nbetter than bus tickets, but they're also more popular. It seemed\n\njust as well to use an inferior example rather than offend more\n\npeople by telling them their hobby doesn't matter.[2] I worried a little about using the word \"disinterested,\" since\n\nsome people mistakenly believe it means not interested. But anyone\n\nwho expects to be a genius will have to know the meaning of such a\n\nbasic word, so I figure they may as well start now.[3] Think how often genius must have been nipped in the bud by\n\npeople being told, or telling themselves, to stop messing about and\n\nbe responsible. Ramanujan's mother was a huge enabler. Imagine if\n\nshe hadn't been. Imagine if his parents had made him go out and get\n\na job instead of sitting around at home doing math.On the other hand, anyone quoting the preceding paragraph to justify\n\nnot getting a job is probably mistaken.[4] 1709 Darwin is to time what the Milanese Leonardo is to space.[5] \"An infinite capacity for taking pains\" is a paraphrase of what\n\nCarlyle wrote. What he wrote, in his History of Frederick the Great,\n\nwas \"... it is the fruit of 'genius' (which means transcendent\n\ncapacity of taking trouble, first of all)....\" Since the paraphrase\n\nseems the name of the idea at this point, I kept it.Carlyle's History was published in 1858. In 1785 Hérault de Séchelles\n\nquoted Buffon as saying \"Le génie n'est qu'une plus grande aptitude\n\nà la patience.\" (Genius is only a greater aptitude for patience.)[6] Trollope was establishing the system of postal routes. He himself\n\nsensed the obsessiveness with which he pursued this goal.\n\nIt is amusing to watch how a passion will grow upon a man. During\n\nthose two years it was the ambition of my life to cover the\n\ncountry with rural letter-carriers.\n\nEven Newton occasionally sensed the degree of his obsessiveness.\n\nAfter computing pi to 15 digits, he wrote in a letter to a friend:\n\nI am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these\n\ncomputations, having no other business at the time.\n\nIncidentally, Ramanujan was also a compulsive calculator. As Kanigel\n\nwrites in his excellent biography:\n\nOne Ramanujan scholar, B. M. Wilson, later told how Ramanujan's\n\nresearch into number theory was often \"preceded by a table of\n\nnumerical results, carried usually to a length from which most\n\nof us would shrink.\"\n\n[7] Working to understand the natural world counts as creating\n\nrather than consuming.Newton tripped over this distinction when he chose\n\nto work on theology. His beliefs did not allow him to see it, but\n\nchasing down paradoxes in nature is fruitful in a way that chasing\n\ndown paradoxes in sacred texts is not.[8] How much of people's propensity to become interested in a topic\n\nis inborn?  My experience so far suggests the answer is: most of\n\nit. Different kids get interested in different things, and it's\n\nhard to make a child interested in something they wouldn't otherwise\n\nbe. Not in a way that sticks.  The most you can do on behalf of a\n\ntopic is to make sure it gets a fair showing  to make it clear to\n\nthem, for example, that there's more to math than the dull drills\n\nthey do in school. After that it's up to the child.Thanks to Marc Andreessen, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Kevin\n\nLacker, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Lisa\n\nRandall, Zak Stone, and my 7 year old for reading drafts of this.Spanish TranslationRussian TranslationKorean TranslationArmenian Translation", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 2592, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:51.056447Z"}

But general and surprising is a hard\n\ncombination to achieve. That territory tends to be picked\n\nclean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the\n\nother: either surprising without being general (e.g.\n\ngossip), or general without being surprising (e.g.\n\nplatitudes).Where things get interesting is the moderately valuable\n\ninsights.  You get those from small additions of whichever\n\nquality was missing.  The more common case is a small\n\naddition of generality: a piece of gossip that's more than\n\njust gossip, because it teaches something interesting about\n\nthe world. But another less common approach is to focus on\n\nthe most general ideas and see if you can find something new\n\nto say about them. Because these start out so general, you\n\nonly need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful\n\ninsight.A small delta of novelty is all you'll be able to get most\n\nof the time. Which means if you take this route, your ideas\n\nwill seem a lot like ones that already exist. Sometimes\n\nyou'll find you've merely rediscovered an idea that did\n\nalready exist.  But don't be discouraged.  Remember the huge\n\nmultiplier that kicks in when you do manage to think of\n\nsomething even a little new.Corollary: the more general the ideas you're talking about,\n\nthe less you should worry about repeating yourself.

{"id": "pgh", "title": "How to Make Pittsburgh a Startup Hub", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/pgh.html", "date": "2016-04", "content": "April 2016(This is a talk I gave at an event called Opt412 in Pittsburgh.\n\nMuch of it will apply to other towns.  But not all, because\n\nas I say in the talk, Pittsburgh has some important advantages over\n\nmost would-be startup hubs.)What would it take to make Pittsburgh into a startup hub, like\n\nSilicon Valley?  I understand Pittsburgh pretty well,\n\nbecause I grew up here, in Monroeville. And I understand Silicon\n\nValley pretty well because that's where I live now.  Could you get\n\nthat kind of startup ecosystem going here?When I agreed to speak here, I didn't think I'd be able to give a\n\nvery optimistic talk.  I thought I'd be talking about what Pittsburgh\n\ncould do to become a startup hub, very much in the subjunctive.\n\nInstead I'm going to talk about what Pittsburgh can do.What changed my mind was an article I read in, of all places, the New\n\nYork Times food section.  The title was \"Pittsburgh's Youth-Driven\n\nFood Boom.\"  To most people that might not even sound interesting,\n\nlet alone something related to startups.  But it was electrifying\n\nto me to read that title.  I don't think I could pick a more promising\n\none if I tried.  And when I read the article I got even more excited.\n\nIt said \"people ages 25 to 29 now make up 7.6 percent of all\n\nresidents, up from 7 percent about a decade ago.\"  Wow, I thought,\n\nPittsburgh could be the next Portland.  It could become the cool\n\nplace all the people in their twenties want to go live.When I got here a couple days ago, I could feel the difference.  I\n\nlived here from 1968 to 1984.  I didn't realize it at the time, but\n\nduring that whole period the city was in free fall. On top of the\n\nflight to the suburbs that happened everywhere, the steel and nuclear\n\nbusinesses were both dying. Boy are things different now.  It's not\n\njust that downtown seems a lot more prosperous. There is an energy\n\nhere that was not here when I was a kid.When I was a kid, this was a place young people left. Now it's a\n\nplace that attracts them.What does that have to do with startups?  Startups are made\n\nof people, and the average age of the people in a typical startup\n\nis right in that 25 to 29 bracket.I've seen how powerful it is for a city to have those people.  Five\n\nyears ago they shifted the center of gravity of Silicon Valley from\n\nthe peninsula to San Francisco.  Google and Facebook are on the\n\npeninsula, but the next generation of big winners are all in SF.\n\nThe reason the center of gravity shifted was the talent war, for\n\nprogrammers especially.  Most 25 to 29 year olds want to live in\n\nthe city, not down in the boring suburbs.  So whether they like it\n\nor not, founders know they have to be in the city.  I know multiple\n\nfounders who would have preferred to live down in the Valley proper,\n\nbut who made themselves move to SF because they knew otherwise\n\nthey'd lose the talent war.So being a magnet for people in their twenties is a very promising\n\nthing to be.  It's hard to imagine a place becoming a startup hub\n\nwithout also being that.  When I read that statistic about the\n\nincreasing percentage of 25 to 29 year olds, I had exactly the same\n\nfeeling of excitement I get when I see a startup's graphs start to\n\ncreep upward off the x axis.Nationally the percentage of 25 to 29 year olds is 6.8%.  That means\n\nyou're .8% ahead.  The population is 306,000, so we're talking about\n\na surplus of about 2500 people.  That's the population of a small\n\ntown, and that's just the surplus. So you have a toehold.  Now you\n\njust have to expand it.And though \"youth-driven food boom\" may sound frivolous, it is\n\nanything but.  Restaurants and cafes are a big part of the personality\n\nof a city.  Imagine walking down a street in Paris. What are you\n\nwalking past?  Little restaurants and cafes.  Imagine driving through\n\nsome depressing random exurb.  What are you driving past?  Starbucks\n\nand McDonalds and Pizza Hut.   As Gertrude Stein said, there is no\n\nthere there. You could be anywhere.These independent restaurants and cafes are not just feeding people.\n\nThey're making there be a there here.So here is my first concrete recommendation for turning Pittsburgh\n\ninto the next Silicon Valley: do everything you can to encourage\n\nthis youth-driven food boom.  What could the city do?  Treat the\n\npeople starting these little restaurants and cafes as your users,\n\nand go ask them what they want.  I can guess at least one thing\n\nthey might want: a fast permit process.  San Francisco has left you\n\na huge amount of room to beat them in that department.I know restaurants aren't the prime mover though.  The prime mover,\n\nas the Times article said, is cheap housing.  That's a big advantage.\n\nBut that phrase \"cheap housing\" is a bit misleading.  There are\n\nplenty of places that are cheaper.  What's special about Pittsburgh\n\nis not that it's cheap, but that it's a cheap place you'd actually\n\nwant to live.Part of that is the buildings themselves. I realized a long time\n\nago, back when I was a poor twenty-something myself, that the best\n\ndeals were places that had once been rich, and then became poor.\n\nIf a place has always been rich, it's nice but too expensive.  If\n\na place has always been poor, it's cheap but grim.  But if a place\n\nwas once rich and then got poor, you can find palaces for cheap.\n\nAnd that's what's bringing people here.  When Pittsburgh was rich,\n\na hundred years ago, the people who lived here built big solid\n\nbuildings.  Not always in the best taste, but definitely solid.  So\n\nhere is another piece of advice for becoming a startup hub: don't\n\ndestroy the buildings that are bringing people here.  When cities\n\nare on the way back up, like Pittsburgh is now, developers race to\n\ntear down the old buildings.  Don't let that happen.  Focus on\n\nhistoric preservation.  Big real estate development projects are\n\nnot what's bringing the twenty-somethings here.  They're the opposite\n\nof the new restaurants and cafes; they subtract personality from\n\nthe city.The empirical evidence suggests you cannot be too strict about\n\nhistoric preservation.  The tougher cities are about it, the better\n\nthey seem to do.But the appeal of Pittsburgh is not just the buildings themselves.\n\nIt's the neighborhoods they're in. Like San Francisco and New York,\n\nPittsburgh is fortunate in being a pre-car city.  It's not too\n\nspread out. Because those 25 to 29 year olds do not like driving.\n\nThey prefer walking, or bicycling, or taking public transport.  If\n\nyou've been to San Francisco recently you can't help noticing the\n\nhuge number of bicyclists.  And this is not just a fad that the\n\ntwenty-somethings have adopted.  In this respect they have discovered\n\na better way to live.  The beards will go, but not the bikes.  Cities\n\nwhere you can get around without driving are just better period.\n\nSo I would suggest you do everything you can to capitalize on this.\n\nAs with historic preservation, it seems impossible to go too far.Why not make Pittsburgh the most bicycle and pedestrian friendly\n\ncity in the country?  See if you can go so far that you make San\n\nFrancisco seem backward by comparison.  If you do, it's very unlikely\n\nyou'll regret it.  The city will seem like a paradise to the young\n\npeople you want to attract.  If they do leave to get jobs elsewhere,\n\nit will be with regret at leaving behind such a place.  And what's\n\nthe downside?  Can you imagine a headline \"City ruined by becoming\n\ntoo bicycle-friendly?\"  It just doesn't happen.So suppose cool old neighborhoods and cool little restaurants make\n\nthis the next Portland.  Will that be enough?  It will put you in\n\na way better position than Portland itself, because Pittsburgh has\n\nsomething Portland lacks: a first-rate research university.  CMU\n\nplus little cafes means you have more than hipsters drinking lattes.\n\nIt means you have hipsters drinking lattes while talking about\n\ndistributed systems.  Now you're getting really close to San\n\nFrancisco.In fact you're better off than San Francisco in one way, because\n\nCMU is downtown, but Stanford and Berkeley are out in the suburbs.What can CMU do to help Pittsburgh become a startup hub?  Be an\n\neven better research university.  CMU is one of the best universities\n\nin the world, but imagine what things would be like if it were the\n\nvery best, and everyone knew it.  There are a lot of ambitious\n\npeople who must go to the best place, wherever it is.  If CMU were it, they would all come here. There would be\n\nkids in Kazakhstan dreaming of one day living in Pittsburgh.Being that kind of talent magnet is the most important contribution\n\nuniversities can make toward making their city a startup hub.  In\n\nfact it is practically the only contribution they can make.But wait, shouldn't universities be setting up programs with words\n\nlike \"innovation\" and \"entrepreneurship\" in their names?  No, they\n\nshould not.  These kind of things almost always turn out to be\n\ndisappointments.  They're pursuing the wrong targets.  The way to\n\nget innovation is not to aim for innovation but to aim for something\n\nmore specific, like better batteries or better 3D printing.  And\n\nthe way to learn about entrepreneurship is to do it, which you\n\ncan't\n\nin school.I know it may disappoint some administrators to hear that the best\n\nthing a university can do to encourage startups is to be a great\n\nuniversity.  It's like telling people who want to lose weight that\n\nthe way to do it is to eat less.But if you want to know where startups come from, look at the\n\nempirical evidence.  Look at the histories of the most successful\n\nstartups, and you'll find they grow organically out of a couple of\n\nfounders building something that starts as an interesting side\n\nproject.  Universities are great at bringing together founders, but\n\nbeyond that the best thing they can do is get out of the way.  For\n\nexample, by not claiming ownership of \"intellectual property\" that\n\nstudents and faculty develop, and by having liberal rules about\n\ndeferred admission and leaves of absence.In fact, one of the most effective things a university could do to\n\nencourage startups is an elaborate form of getting out of the way\n\ninvented by Harvard.  Harvard used to have exams for the fall\n\nsemester after Christmas.  At the beginning of January they had\n\nsomething called \"Reading Period\" when you were supposed to be\n\nstudying for exams.  And Microsoft and Facebook have something in\n\ncommon that few people realize: they were both started during Reading\n\nPeriod.  It's the perfect situation for producing the sort of side\n\nprojects that turn into startups. The students are all on campus,\n\nbut they don't have to do anything because they're supposed to be\n\nstudying for exams.Harvard may have closed this window, because a few years ago they\n\nmoved exams before Christmas and shortened reading period from 11\n\ndays to 7.  But if a university really wanted to help its students\n\nstart startups, the empirical evidence, weighted by market cap,\n\nsuggests the best thing they can do is literally nothing.The culture of Pittsburgh is another of its strengths.  It seems\n\nlike a city has to be socially liberal to be a startup hub,\n\nand it's pretty clear why. A city has to tolerate strangeness to\n\nbe a home for startups, because startups are so strange.  And you\n\ncan't choose to allow just the forms of strangeness that will turn\n\ninto big startups, because they're all intermingled.  You have to\n\ntolerate all strangeness.That immediately rules out big chunks of the US.  I'm optimistic\n\nit doesn't rule out Pittsburgh.  One of the things I remember from\n\ngrowing up here, though I didn't realize at the time that there was\n\nanything unusual about it, is how well people got along.  I'm still\n\nnot sure why.  Maybe one reason was that everyone felt like an\n\nimmigrant.  When I was a kid in Monroeville, people didn't call\n\nthemselves American.  They called themselves Italian or Serbian or\n\nUkranian.  Just imagine what it must have been like here a hundred\n\nyears ago, when people were pouring in from twenty different\n\ncountries.  Tolerance was the only option.What I remember about the culture of Pittsburgh is that it was\n\nboth tolerant and pragmatic.  That's how I'd describe the culture\n\nof Silicon Valley too.  And it's not a coincidence, because Pittsburgh\n\nwas the Silicon Valley of its time.  This was a city where people\n\nbuilt new things.  And while the things people build have changed,\n\nthe spirit you need to do that kind of work is the same.So although an influx of latte-swilling hipsters may be annoying\n\nin some ways, I would go out of my way to encourage them.  And more\n\ngenerally to tolerate strangeness, even unto the degree wacko\n\nCalifornians do.  For Pittsburgh that is a conservative choice:\n\nit's a return to the city's roots.Unfortunately I saved the toughest part for last. There is one more\n\nthing you need to be a startup hub, and Pittsburgh hasn't got it:\n\ninvestors.  Silicon Valley has a big investor community because\n\nit's had 50 years to grow one.  New York has a big investor community\n\nbecause it's full of people who like money a lot and are quick to\n\nnotice new ways to get it.  But Pittsburgh has neither of these.\n\nAnd the cheap housing that draws other people here has no effect\n\non investors.If an investor community grows up here, it will happen the same way\n\nit did in Silicon Valley: slowly and organically.  So I would not\n\nbet on having a big investor community in the short term.  But\n\nfortunately there are three trends that make that less necessary\n\nthan it used to be.  One is that startups are increasingly cheap\n\nto start, so you just don't need as much outside money as you used\n\nto.  The second is that thanks to things like Kickstarter, a startup\n\ncan get to revenue faster.  You can put something on Kickstarter\n\nfrom anywhere.  The third is programs like Y Combinator.  A startup\n\nfrom anywhere in the world can go to YC for 3 months, pick up\n\nfunding, and then return home if they want.My advice is to make Pittsburgh a great place for startups, and\n\ngradually more of them will stick.  Some of those will succeed;\n\nsome of their founders will become investors; and still more startups\n\nwill stick.This is not a fast path to becoming a startup hub. But it is at\n\nleast a path, which is something few other cities have.  And it's\n\nnot as if you have to make painful sacrifices in the meantime.\n\nThink about what I've suggested you should do.  Encourage local\n\nrestaurants, save old buildings, take advantage of density, make\n\nCMU the best, promote tolerance.  These are the things that make\n\nPittsburgh good to live in now.  All I'm saying is that you should\n\ndo even more of them.And that's an encouraging thought.  If Pittsburgh's path to becoming\n\na startup hub is to be even more itself, then it has a good chance\n\nof succeeding.  In fact it probably has the best chance of any city\n\nits size.  It will take some effort, and a lot of time, but if any\n\ncity can do it, Pittsburgh can.Thanks to Charlie Cheever and Jessica Livingston for reading\n\ndrafts of this, and to Meg Cheever for organizing Opt412 and inviting\n\nme to speak.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 2599, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:53.523377Z"}
{"id": "vb", "title": "Life is Short", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/vb.html", "date": null, "content": "January 2016Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder\n\nabout this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining\n\nabout its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was\n\nshort if we lived 10 times as long?Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped\n\nwondering about it.  Then I had kids.  That gave me a way to answer\n\nthe question, and the answer is that life actually is short.Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time,\n\ninto discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year\n\nold.  If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only\n\nget to watch your child experience it 8 times.  And while it's\n\nimpossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity\n\nlike time, 8 is not a lot of something.  If you had a handful of 8\n\npeanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would\n\ndefinitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.Ok, so life actually is short.  Does it make any difference to know\n\nthat?It has for me.  It means arguments of the form \"Life is too short\n\nfor x\" have great force.  It's not just a figure of speech to say\n\nthat life is too short for something.  It's not just a synonym for\n\nannoying.  If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for\n\nsomething, you should try to eliminate it if you can.When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word\n\nthat pops into my head is \"bullshit.\" I realize that answer is\n\nsomewhat tautological.  It's almost the definition of bullshit that\n\nit's the stuff that life is too short for.  And yet bullshit does\n\nhave a distinctive character.  There's something fake about it.\n\nIt's the junk food of experience.\n\n[1]If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit,\n\nyou probably already know the answer.  Unnecessary meetings, pointless\n\ndisputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's\n\nmistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's\n\neither forced on you, or it tricks you.  To some extent you have to\n\nput up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances.  You need\n\nto make money, and making money consists mostly of errands.  Indeed,\n\nthe law of supply and demand ensures that: the more rewarding some\n\nkind of work is, the cheaper people will do it.  It may be that\n\nless bullshit is forced on you than you think, though.  There has\n\nalways been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and\n\ngo live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional\n\nsense, but life feels more authentic.  This could become more common.You can do it on a smaller scale without moving.  The amount of\n\ntime you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers.  Most\n\nlarge organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it.  But\n\nif you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors\n\nlike money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will\n\nwaste less of your time.If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the\n\nlevel of individual customers.  If you fire or avoid toxic customers,\n\nyou can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than\n\nyou decrease your income.But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the\n\nbullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's\n\nfault but your own.  And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder\n\nto eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you.  Things that\n\nlure you into wasting your time have to be really good at\n\ntricking you.  An example that will be familiar to a lot of people\n\nis arguing online.  When someone\n\ncontradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty\n\novertly.  Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself.  But\n\nlike a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we\n\nnow live in.  Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of\n\nthe time not to defend yourself.  Otherwise these people are literally\n\ntaking your life.\n\n[2]Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more\n\ndangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct\n\nof technical progress is that things we like tend to become more\n\naddictive.  Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious\n\neffort to avoid addictions  to stand outside ourselves and ask \"is\n\nthis how I want to be spending my time?\"As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things\n\nthat matter.  But different things matter to different people, and\n\nmost have to learn what matters to them.  A few are lucky and realize\n\nearly on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing,\n\nand then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.  But\n\nmost people start out with a life that's a mix of things that\n\nmatter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish\n\nbetween them.For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the\n\nartificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and\n\nhigh school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important\n\nthing in the world.  But when you ask adults what they got wrong\n\nat that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids\n\nthought of them.One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask\n\nyourself whether you'll care about it in the future.  Fake stuff\n\nthat matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter.  That's\n\nhow it tricks you.  The area under the curve is small, but its shape\n\njabs into your consciousness like a pin.The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would\n\ncall \"important.\"  Having coffee with a friend matters.  You won't\n\nfeel later like that was a waste of time.One great thing about having small children is that they make you\n\nspend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as\n\nyou're staring at your phone and say \"will you play with me?\" And\n\nodds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by\n\nsurprise. And that is just what tends to happen.  You take things\n\nfor granted, and then they're gone.  You think you can always write\n\nthat book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize\n\nthe window has closed.  The saddest windows close when other people\n\ndie. Their lives are short too.  After my mother died, I wished I'd\n\nspent more time with her.  I lived as if she'd always be there.\n\nAnd in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion.  But an\n\nillusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I\n\ndid.The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to\n\nbe consciously aware of it.  Back when life was more precarious,\n\npeople used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a\n\nbit morbid.  I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer\n\nto be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at\n\neveryone's shoulder.  Perhaps a better solution is to look at the\n\nproblem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about\n\nthe things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that\n\nmountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.  You don't\n\nneed to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait.\n\nJust don't wait.I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much\n\nof something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has.  Both\n\nmake sense here.How you live affects how long you live.  Most people could do better.\n\nMe among them.But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention\n\nto the time you have.  It's easy to let the days rush by.  The\n\n\"flow\" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin\n\nthat prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry\n\nof errands and alarms.  One of the most striking things I've read\n\nwas not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's Burning\n\nthe Days.It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it.\n\nKids help.  When you have small children, there are a lot of moments\n\nso perfect that you can't help noticing.It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of\n\nsome experience.  The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just\n\nthat I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have\n\ndone that we didn't.  My oldest son will be 7 soon.  And while I\n\nmiss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets\n\nover what might have been.  We had the best time a daddy and a 3\n\nyear old ever had.Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter,\n\nand savor the time you have.  That's what you do when life is short.Notes[1]\n\nAt first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was\n\none that had other meanings.  But then I realized the other meanings\n\nare fairly closely related.  Bullshit in the sense of things you\n\nwaste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.[2]\n\nI chose this example deliberately as a note to self.  I get\n\nattacked a lot online.  People tell the craziest lies about me.\n\nAnd I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the\n\nnatural human inclination to say \"Hey, that's not true!\"Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Geoff Ralston for reading drafts\n\nof this.Korean TranslationJapanese TranslationChinese Translation", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1649, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:54.110851Z"}
{"id": "ineq", "title": "Economic Inequality", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/ineq.html", "date": null, "content": "January 2016Since the 1970s, economic inequality in the US has increased\n\ndramatically. And in particular, the rich have gotten a lot richer.\n\nNearly everyone who writes about the topic says that economic inequality\n\nshould be decreased.I'm interested in this question because I was one of the founders of\n\na company called Y Combinator that helps people start startups.\n\nAlmost by definition, if a startup succeeds, its founders become\n\nrich. Which means by helping startup founders I've been helping to\n\nincrease economic inequality.  If economic inequality should be\n\ndecreased, I shouldn't be helping founders. No one should\n\nbe.But that doesn't sound right. What's going on here? What's going\n\non is that while economic inequality is a single measure (or more\n\nprecisely, two: variation in income, and variation in wealth), it\n\nhas multiple causes. Many of these causes are bad, like tax loopholes\n\nand drug addiction. But some are good, like Larry Page and\n\nSergey Brin starting the company you use to find things online.If you want to understand economic inequality — and more importantly,\n\nif you actually want to fix the bad aspects of it — you have to\n\ntease apart the components.  And yet the trend in nearly everything\n\nwritten about the subject is to do the opposite: to squash together\n\nall the aspects of economic inequality as if it were a single\n\nphenomenon.Sometimes this is done for ideological reasons.  Sometimes it's\n\nbecause the writer only has very high-level data and so draws\n\nconclusions from that, like the proverbial drunk who looks for his\n\nkeys under the lamppost, instead of where he dropped them, because the\n\nlight is better there.  Sometimes it's because the writer doesn't\n\nunderstand critical aspects of inequality, like the role of technology\n\nin wealth creation.  Much of the time, perhaps most of the time,\n\nwriting about economic inequality combines all three.___The most common mistake people make about economic inequality is\n\nto treat it as a single phenomenon.  The most naive version of which\n\nis the one based on the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by\n\ntaking money from the poor.Usually this is an assumption people start from rather than a\n\nconclusion they arrive at by examining the evidence.  Sometimes the\n\npie fallacy is stated explicitly:\n\n...those at the top are grabbing an increasing fraction of the\n\nnation's income — so much of a larger share that what's left over\n\nfor the rest is diminished....\n\n[1]\n\nOther times it's more unconscious. But the unconscious form is very\n\nwidespread.  I think because we grow up in a world where the pie\n\nfallacy is actually true.  To kids, wealth is a fixed pie\n\nthat's shared out, and if one person gets more, it's at the expense\n\nof another.  It takes a conscious effort to remind oneself that the\n\nreal world doesn't work that way.In the real world you can create wealth as well as taking it from\n\nothers.  A woodworker creates wealth.  He makes a chair, and you\n\nwillingly give him money in return for it.  A high-frequency trader\n\ndoes not.  He makes a dollar only when someone on the other end of\n\na trade loses a dollar.If the rich people in a society got that way by taking wealth from\n\nthe poor, then you have the degenerate case of economic inequality,\n\nwhere the cause of poverty is the same as the cause of wealth.  But\n\ninstances of inequality don't have to be instances of the degenerate\n\ncase.  If one woodworker makes 5 chairs and another makes none, the\n\nsecond woodworker will have less money, but not because anyone took\n\nanything from him.Even people sophisticated enough to know about the pie fallacy are\n\nled toward it by the custom of describing economic inequality as a\n\nratio of one quantile's income or wealth to another's.  It's so\n\neasy to slip from talking about income shifting from one quantile\n\nto another, as a figure of speech, into believing that is literally\n\nwhat's happening.Except in the degenerate case, economic inequality can't be described\n\nby a ratio or even a curve.  In the general case it consists of\n\nmultiple ways people become poor, and multiple ways people become\n\nrich.  Which means to understand economic inequality in a country,\n\nyou have to go find individual people who are poor or rich and\n\nfigure out why.\n\n[2]If you want to understand change in economic inequality, you\n\nshould ask what those people would have done when it was different.\n\nThis is one way I know the rich aren't all getting richer simply\n\nfrom some new system for transferring wealth to them from\n\neveryone else.  When you use the would-have method with startup\n\nfounders, you find what most would have done\n\nback in 1960, when\n\neconomic inequality was lower, was to join big companies or become\n\nprofessors.  Before Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, his default\n\nexpectation was that he'd end up working at Microsoft.  The reason\n\nhe and most other startup founders are richer than they would have\n\nbeen in the mid 20th century is not because of some right turn the\n\ncountry took during the Reagan administration, but because progress\n\nin technology has made it much easier to start a new company that\n\ngrows fast.Traditional economists seem strangely averse to studying individual\n\nhumans. It seems to be a rule with them that everything has to start\n\nwith statistics.  So they give you very precise numbers about\n\nvariation in wealth and income, then follow it with the most naive\n\nspeculation about the underlying causes.But while there are a lot of people who get rich through rent-seeking\n\nof various forms, and a lot who get rich by playing zero-sum games,\n\nthere are also a significant number\n\nwho get rich by creating wealth.  And creating wealth, as a source\n\nof economic inequality, is different from taking it — not just\n\nmorally, but also practically, in the sense that it is harder to\n\neradicate.  One reason is that variation in productivity is\n\naccelerating.  The rate at which individuals can create wealth\n\ndepends on the technology available to them, and that grows\n\nexponentially. The other reason creating wealth is such a tenacious\n\nsource of inequality is that it can expand to accommodate a lot of\n\npeople.___I'm all for shutting down the crooked ways to get rich.  But that\n\nwon't eliminate great variations in wealth, because as long as you leave\n\nopen the option of getting rich by creating wealth, people who want\n\nto get rich will do that instead.Most people who get rich tend to be fairly driven. Whatever their\n\nother flaws, laziness is usually not one of them.  Suppose new\n\npolicies make it hard to make a fortune in finance. Does it seem\n\nplausible that the people who currently go into finance to make\n\ntheir fortunes will continue to do so, but be content to work for\n\nordinary salaries? The reason they go into finance is not because\n\nthey love finance but because they want to get rich. If the only\n\nway left to get rich is to start startups, they'll start startups.\n\nThey'll do well at it too, because determination is the main factor\n\nin the success of a startup.\n\n[3]\n\nAnd while it would probably be\n\na good thing for the world if people who wanted to get rich switched\n\nfrom playing zero-sum games to creating wealth, that would not only\n\nnot eliminate great variations in wealth, but might even\n\nexacerbate them.\n\nIn a zero-sum game there is at least a limit to the upside.  Plus\n\na lot of the new startups would create new technology that further\n\naccelerated variation in productivity.Variation in productivity is far from the only source of economic\n\ninequality, but it is the irreducible core of it, in the sense that\n\nyou'll have that left when you eliminate all other sources. And if\n\nyou do, that core will be big, because it will have expanded to\n\ninclude the efforts of all the refugees.  Plus it will have a large\n\nBaumol penumbra around it: anyone who could get rich by creating\n\nwealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to prevent\n\nthem from doing it.You can't prevent great variations in wealth without preventing people\n\nfrom getting rich, and you can't do that without preventing them\n\nfrom starting startups.So let's be clear about that. Eliminating great variations in wealth would\n\nmean eliminating startups.  And that doesn't seem a wise move.\n\nEspecially since it would only mean you eliminated\n\nstartups in your own country.  Ambitious people already move halfway\n\naround the world to further their careers, and startups can operate\n\nfrom anywhere nowadays.  So if you made it impossible to get rich\n\nby creating wealth in your country, people who wanted to do that\n\nwould just leave and do it somewhere else. Which would\n\ncertainly get you a lower Gini coefficient, along with a lesson in\n\nbeing careful what you ask for.\n\n[4]I think rising economic inequality is the inevitable fate of countries\n\nthat don't choose something worse. We had a 40 year stretch in the\n\nmiddle of the 20th century that convinced some people otherwise.\n\nBut as I explained in The Refragmentation,\n\nthat was an anomaly — a\n\nunique combination of circumstances that compressed American society\n\nnot just economically but culturally too.\n\n[5]And while some of the growth in economic inequality we've seen since\n\nthen has been due to bad behavior of various kinds, there has\n\nsimultaneously been a huge increase in individuals' ability to\n\ncreate wealth.  Startups are almost entirely a product of this\n\nperiod. And even within the startup world, there has been a qualitative\n\nchange in the last 10 years.  Technology has decreased the cost of\n\nstarting a startup so much that founders now have the upper hand\n\nover investors.  Founders get less diluted, and it is now common\n\nfor them to retain\n\nboard control as well.  Both further increase\n\neconomic inequality, the former because founders own more stock,\n\nand the latter because, as investors have learned, founders tend\n\nto be better at running their companies than investors.While the surface manifestations change, the underlying forces are\n\nvery, very old.  The acceleration of productivity we see in Silicon\n\nValley has been happening for thousands of years.  If you look at\n\nthe history of stone tools, technology was already accelerating in\n\nthe Mesolithic.  The acceleration would have been too slow to\n\nperceive in one lifetime.  Such is the nature of the leftmost part\n\nof an exponential curve.  But it was the same curve.You do not want to design your society in a way that's incompatible\n\nwith this curve. The evolution of technology is one of the most\n\npowerful forces in history.Louis Brandeis said \"We may have democracy, or we may have wealth\n\nconcentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\" That\n\nsounds plausible.  But if I have to choose between ignoring him and\n\nignoring an exponential curve that has been operating for thousands\n\nof years, I'll bet on the curve.  Ignoring any trend that has been\n\noperating for thousands of years is dangerous.  But exponential\n\ngrowth, especially, tends to bite you.___If accelerating variation in productivity is always going to produce\n\nsome baseline growth in economic inequality, it would be a good\n\nidea to spend some time thinking about that future.  Can you have\n\na healthy society with great variation in wealth?  What would it\n\nlook like?Notice how novel it feels to think about that.  The public conversation\n\nso far has been exclusively about the need to decrease economic\n\ninequality.  We've barely given a thought to how to live with it.I'm hopeful we'll be able to.  Brandeis was a product of the Gilded\n\nAge, and things have changed since then. It's harder to hide\n\nwrongdoing now.  And to get rich now you don't have to buy politicians\n\nthe way railroad or oil magnates did.\n\n[6]\n\nThe great concentrations\n\nof wealth I see around me in Silicon Valley don't seem to be\n\ndestroying democracy.There are lots of things wrong with the US that have economic\n\ninequality as a symptom. We should fix those things.  In the process\n\nwe may decrease economic inequality. But we can't start from the\n\nsymptom and hope to fix the underlying causes.\n\n[7]The most obvious is poverty. I'm sure most of those who want to\n\ndecrease economic inequality want to do it mainly to help the poor,\n\nnot to hurt the rich.\n\n[8]\n\nIndeed, a good number are merely being\n\nsloppy by speaking of decreasing economic inequality when what they\n\nmean is decreasing poverty.  But this is a situation where it would\n\nbe good to be precise about what we want.  Poverty and economic\n\ninequality are not identical.  When the city is turning off your\n\nwater\n\nbecause you can't pay the bill, it doesn't make any difference\n\nwhat Larry Page's net worth is compared to yours.  He might only\n\nbe a few times richer than you, and it would still be just as much\n\nof a problem that your water was getting turned off.Closely related to poverty is lack of social mobility.  I've seen\n\nthis myself: you don't have to grow up rich or even upper middle\n\nclass to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders\n\ngrew up desperately poor.  But again, the problem here is not simply\n\neconomic inequality.  There is an enormous difference in wealth\n\nbetween the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful\n\nstartup founder, but that didn't prevent him from joining their\n\nranks.  It's not economic inequality per se that's blocking social\n\nmobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrong\n\nwhen kids grow up sufficiently poor.One of the most important principles in Silicon Valley is that \"you\n\nmake what you measure.\"  It means that if you pick some number to\n\nfocus on, it will tend to improve, but that you have to choose the\n\nright number, because only the one you choose will improve; another\n\nthat seems conceptually adjacent might not.  For example, if you're\n\na university president and you decide to focus on graduation rates,\n\nthen you'll improve graduation rates.  But only graduation rates,\n\nnot how much students learn.  Students could learn less, if to\n\nimprove graduation rates you made classes easier.Economic inequality is sufficiently far from identical with the\n\nvarious problems that have it as a symptom that we'll probably only\n\nhit whichever of the two we aim at.  If we aim at economic inequality,\n\nwe won't fix these problems.  So I say let's aim at the problems.For example, let's attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth\n\nin the process. That's much more likely to work than attacking\n\nwealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty.\n\n[9]\n\nAnd if\n\nthere are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying the\n\ngovernment for anti-competitive regulations or tax loopholes, then\n\nlet's stop them. Not because it's causing economic inequality, but\n\nbecause it's stealing.\n\n[10]If all you have is statistics, it seems like that's what you need\n\nto fix. But behind a broad statistical measure like economic\n\ninequality there are some things that are good and some that are\n\nbad, some that are historical trends with immense momentum and\n\nothers that are random accidents.  If we want to fix the world\n\nbehind the statistics, we have to understand it, and focus our\n\nefforts where they'll do the most good.Notes[1]\n\nStiglitz, Joseph. The Price of Inequality. Norton, 2012. p.\n\n32.[2]\n\nParticularly since economic inequality is a matter of outliers,\n\nand outliers are disproportionately likely to have gotten where\n\nthey are by ways that have little do with the sort of things\n\neconomists usually think about, like wages and productivity, but\n\nrather by, say, ending up on the wrong side of the \"War on Drugs.\"[3]\n\nDetermination is the most important factor in deciding between\n\nsuccess and failure, which in startups tend to be sharply differentiated.\n\nBut it takes more than determination to create one of the hugely\n\nsuccessful startups.  Though most founders start out excited about\n\nthe idea of getting rich, purely mercenary founders will usually\n\ntake one of the big acquisition offers most successful startups get\n\non the way up.  The founders who go on to the next stage tend to\n\nbe driven by a sense of mission.  They have the same attachment to\n\ntheir companies that an artist or writer has to their work.  But\n\nit is very hard to predict at the outset which founders will do\n\nthat. It's not simply a function of their initial attitude.  Starting\n\na company changes people.[4]\n\nAfter reading a draft of this essay, Richard Florida told me\n\nhow he had once talked to a group of Europeans \"who said\n\nthey wanted to make Europe more entrepreneurial and more\n\nlike Silicon Valley. I said by definition this will give you more\n\ninequality.  They thought I was insane — they could not process\n\nit.\"[5]\n\nEconomic inequality has been decreasing globally.  But this\n\nis mainly due to the erosion of the kleptocracies that formerly\n\ndominated all the poorer countries.  Once the playing field is\n\nleveler politically, we'll see economic inequality start to rise\n\nagain. The US is the bellwether.  The situation we face here, the\n\nrest of the world will sooner or later.[6]\n\nSome people still get rich by buying politicians.  My point is that\n\nit's no longer a precondition.[7]\n\nAs well as problems that have economic inequality as a symptom,\n\nthere are those that have it as a cause.  But in most if not all,\n\neconomic inequality is not the primary cause.  There is usually\n\nsome injustice that is allowing economic inequality to turn into\n\nother forms of inequality, and that injustice is what we need to\n\nfix.  For example, the police in the US treat the poor worse than\n\nthe rich.  But the solution is not to make people richer. It's to\n\nmake the police treat people more equitably.  Otherwise they'll\n\ncontinue to maltreat people who are weak in other ways.[8]\n\nSome who read this essay will say that I'm clueless or even\n\nbeing deliberately misleading by focusing so much on the richer end\n\nof economic inequality — that economic inequality is really about\n\npoverty. But that is exactly the point I'm making, though sloppier\n\nlanguage than I'd use to make it.  The real problem is poverty, not\n\neconomic inequality.  And if you conflate them you're aiming at the\n\nwrong target.Others will say I'm clueless or being misleading by focusing on\n\npeople who get rich by creating wealth — that startups aren't the\n\nproblem, but corrupt practices in finance, healthcare, and so on.\n\nOnce again, that is exactly my point.  The problem is not economic\n\ninequality, but those specific abuses.It's a strange task to write an essay about why something isn't the\n\nproblem, but that's the situation you find yourself in when so many\n\npeople mistakenly think it is.[9]\n\nParticularly since many causes of poverty are only partially\n\ndriven by people trying to make money from them. For example,\n\nAmerica's abnormally high incarceration rate is a major cause of\n\npoverty.  But although for-profit prison companies and\n\nprison guard unions both spend\n\na lot lobbying for harsh sentencing laws, they\n\nare not the original source of them.[10]\n\nIncidentally, tax loopholes are definitely not a product\n\nof some power shift due to recent increases in economic inequality.\n\nThe golden age of economic equality in the mid 20th century was\n\nalso the golden age of tax avoidance. Indeed, it was so widespread\n\nand so effective that I'm skeptical whether economic inequality was\n\nreally so low then as we think.  In a period when people are trying\n\nto hide wealth from the government, it will tend to be hidden from\n\nstatistics too. One sign of the potential magnitude of the problem\n\nis the discrepancy between government receipts as a percentage of\n\nGDP, which have remained more or less constant during the entire\n\nperiod from the end of World War II to the present, and tax rates,\n\nwhich have varied dramatically.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 3301, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:54.721866Z"}
{"id": "re", "title": "The Refragmentation", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/re.html", "date": null, "content": "January 2016One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in\n\nyour lifetime.  A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation.  US\n\npolitics is much more polarized than it used to be.  Culturally we\n\nhave ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful\n\nof happy cities, abandoning the rest.  And increasing economic\n\ninequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too.\n\nI'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances\n\nof the same phenomenon.  And moreover, that the cause is not some\n\nforce that's pulling us apart, but rather the erosion of forces\n\nthat had been pushing us together.Worse still, for those who worry about these trends, the forces\n\nthat were pushing us together were an anomaly, a one-time combination\n\nof circumstances that's unlikely to be repeated — and indeed, that\n\nwe would not want to repeat.The two forces were war (above all World War II), and the rise of\n\nlarge corporations.The effects of World War II were both economic and social.\n\nEconomically, it decreased variation in income.  Like all modern\n\narmed forces, America's were socialist economically.  From each\n\naccording to his ability, to each according to his need.  More or\n\nless.  Higher ranking members of the military got more (as higher\n\nranking members of socialist societies always do), but what they\n\ngot was fixed according to their rank.  And the flattening effect\n\nwasn't limited to those under arms, because the US economy was\n\nconscripted too.  Between 1942 and 1945 all wages were set by the\n\nNational War Labor Board. Like the military, they defaulted to\n\nflatness.  And this national standardization of wages was so pervasive\n\nthat its effects could still be seen years after the war ended.\n\n[1]Business owners weren't supposed to be making money either.  FDR\n\nsaid \"not a single war millionaire\" would be permitted.  To ensure\n\nthat, any increase in a company's profits over prewar levels was\n\ntaxed at 85%.  And when what was left after corporate taxes reached\n\nindividuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.\n\n[2]Socially too the war tended to decrease variation.  Over 16 million\n\nmen and women from all sorts of different backgrounds were brought\n\ntogether in a way of life that was literally uniform.  Service rates\n\nfor men born in the early 1920s approached 80%. And working toward\n\na common goal, often under stress, brought them still closer together.Though strictly speaking World War II lasted less than 4 years for\n\nthe US, its effects lasted longer.  Wars make central governments\n\nmore powerful, and World War II was an extreme case of this.  In\n\nthe US, as in all the other Allied countries, the federal government\n\nwas slow to give up the new powers it had acquired.  Indeed, in\n\nsome respects the war didn't end in 1945; the enemy just switched\n\nto the Soviet Union.  In tax rates, federal power, defense spending,\n\nconscription, and nationalism, the decades after the war looked more\n\nlike wartime than prewar peacetime.\n\n[3]\n\nAnd the social effects\n\nlasted too.  The kid pulled into the army from behind a mule team\n\nin West Virginia didn't simply go back to the farm afterward.\n\nSomething else was waiting for him, something that looked a lot\n\nlike the army.If total war was the big political story of the 20th century, the\n\nbig economic story was the rise of a new kind of company.  And this\n\ntoo tended to produce both social and economic cohesion.\n\n[4]The 20th century was the century of the big, national corporation.\n\nGeneral Electric, General Foods, General Motors.  Developments in\n\nfinance, communications, transportation, and manufacturing enabled\n\na new type of company whose goal was above all scale.  Version 1\n\nof this world was low-res: a Duplo world of a few giant companies\n\ndominating each big market.\n\n[5]The late 19th and early 20th centuries had been a time of consolidation,\n\nled especially by J. P. Morgan.  Thousands of companies run by their\n\nfounders were merged into a couple hundred giant ones run by\n\nprofessional managers. Economies of scale ruled the day.  It seemed\n\nto people at the time that this was the final state of things.  John\n\nD. Rockefeller said in 1880\n\nThe day of combination is here to stay. Individualism has gone,\n\nnever to return.\n\nHe turned out to be mistaken, but he seemed right for the next\n\nhundred years.The consolidation that began in the late 19th century continued for\n\nmost of the 20th.  By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind\n\nwrites, \"the major sectors of the economy were either organized\n\nas government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic\n\ncorporations.\"For consumers this new world meant the same choices everywhere, but\n\nonly a few of them.  When I grew up there were only 2 or 3 of most\n\nthings, and since they were all aiming at the middle of the market\n\nthere wasn't much to differentiate them.One of the most important instances of this phenomenon was in TV.\n\nHere there were 3 choices: NBC, CBS, and ABC. Plus public TV for\n\neggheads and communists.  The programs that the 3 networks offered were\n\nindistinguishable.  In fact, here there was a triple pressure toward\n\nthe center. If one show did try something daring, local affiliates\n\nin conservative markets would make them stop. Plus since TVs were\n\nexpensive, whole families watched the same shows together, so they\n\nhad to be suitable for everyone.And not only did everyone get the same thing, they got it at the\n\nsame time.  It's difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of\n\nmillions of families would sit down together in front of their TV\n\nset watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door\n\nneighbors.  What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen\n\nevery night. We were literally in sync.\n\n[6]In a way mid-century TV culture was good. The view it gave of the\n\nworld was like you'd find in a children's book, and it probably had\n\nsomething of the effect that (parents hope) children's books have\n\nin making people behave better.  But, like children's books, TV was\n\nalso misleading.  Dangerously misleading, for adults. In his\n\nautobiography, Robert MacNeil talks of seeing gruesome images that\n\nhad just come in from Vietnam and thinking, we can't show these to\n\nfamilies while they're having dinner.I know how pervasive the common culture was, because I tried to opt\n\nout of it, and it was practically impossible to find alternatives.\n\nWhen I was 13 I realized, more from internal evidence than any\n\noutside source, that the ideas we were being fed on TV were crap,\n\nand I stopped watching it.\n\n[7]\n\nBut it wasn't just TV.  It seemed\n\nlike everything around me was crap.  The politicians all saying the\n\nsame things, the consumer brands making almost identical products\n\nwith different labels stuck on to indicate how prestigious they\n\nwere meant to be, the balloon-frame houses with fake \"colonial\"\n\nskins, the cars with several feet of gratuitous metal on each end\n\nthat started to fall apart after a couple years, the \"red delicious\"\n\napples that were red but only nominally\n\napples. And in retrospect, it was crap.\n\n[8]But when I went looking for alternatives to fill this void, I found\n\npractically nothing.  There was no Internet then.  The only place\n\nto look was in the chain bookstore in our local shopping mall.\n\n[9]\n\nThere I found a copy of The Atlantic.  I wish I could say it became\n\na gateway into a wider world, but in fact I found it boring and\n\nincomprehensible.  Like a kid tasting whisky for the first time and\n\npretending to like it, I preserved that magazine as carefully as\n\nif it had been a book. I'm sure I still have it somewhere.  But\n\nthough it was evidence that there was, somewhere, a world that\n\nwasn't red delicious, I didn't find it till college.It wasn't just as consumers that the big companies made us similar.\n\nThey did as employers too.  Within companies there were powerful\n\nforces pushing people toward a single model of how to look and act.\n\nIBM was particularly notorious for this, but they were only a little\n\nmore extreme than other big companies.  And the models of how to\n\nlook and act varied little between companies. Meaning everyone\n\nwithin this world was expected to seem more or less the same.  And\n\nnot just those in the corporate world, but also everyone who aspired\n\nto it — which in the middle of the 20th century meant most people\n\nwho weren't already in it.  For most of the 20th century, working-class\n\npeople tried hard to look middle class.  You can see it in old\n\nphotos.  Few adults aspired to look dangerous in 1950.But the rise of national corporations didn't just compress us\n\nculturally.  It compressed us economically too, and on both ends.Along with giant national corporations, we got giant national labor\n\nunions.  And in the mid 20th century the corporations cut deals\n\nwith the unions where they paid over market price for labor.  Partly\n\nbecause the unions were monopolies.\n\n[10]\n\nPartly because, as\n\ncomponents of oligopolies themselves, the corporations knew they\n\ncould safely pass the cost on to their customers, because their\n\ncompetitors would have to as well.  And partly because in mid-century\n\nmost of the giant companies were still focused on finding new ways\n\nto milk economies of scale.  Just as startups rightly pay AWS a\n\npremium over the cost of running their own servers so they can focus\n\non growth, many of the big national corporations were willing to\n\npay a premium for labor.\n\n[11]As well as pushing incomes up from the bottom, by overpaying unions,\n\nthe big companies of the 20th century also pushed incomes down at\n\nthe top, by underpaying their top management. Economist J. K.\n\nGalbraith wrote in 1967 that \"There are few corporations in which\n\nit would be suggested that executive salaries are at a maximum.\"\n\n[12]To some extent this was an illusion.  Much of the de facto pay of\n\nexecutives never showed up on their income tax returns, because it\n\ntook the form of perks.  The higher the rate of income tax, the\n\nmore pressure there was to pay employees upstream of it.  (In the\n\nUK, where taxes were even higher than in the US, companies would\n\neven pay their kids' private school tuitions.)  One of the most\n\nvaluable things the big companies of the mid 20th century gave their\n\nemployees was job security, and this too didn't show up in tax\n\nreturns or income statistics. So the nature of employment in these\n\norganizations tended to yield falsely low numbers about economic\n\ninequality.  But even accounting for that, the big companies paid\n\ntheir best people less than market price.  There was no market; the\n\nexpectation was that you'd work for the same company for decades\n\nif not your whole career.\n\n[13]Your work was so illiquid there was little chance of getting market\n\nprice. But that same illiquidity also encouraged you not to seek\n\nit.  If the company promised to employ you till you retired and\n\ngive you a pension afterward, you didn't want to extract as much\n\nfrom it this year as you could. You needed to take care of the\n\ncompany so it could take care of you.  Especially when you'd been\n\nworking with the same group of people for decades.  If you tried\n\nto squeeze the company for more money, you were squeezing the\n\norganization that was going to take care of them.  Plus if\n\nyou didn't put the company first you wouldn't be promoted, and if\n\nyou couldn't switch ladders, promotion on this one was the only way\n\nup.\n\n[14]To someone who'd spent several formative years in the armed forces,\n\nthis situation didn't seem as strange as it does to us now.  From\n\ntheir point of view, as big company executives, they were high-ranking\n\nofficers.  They got paid a lot more than privates.  They got to\n\nhave expense account lunches at the best restaurants and fly around\n\non the company's Gulfstreams.  It probably didn't occur to most of\n\nthem to ask if they were being paid market price.The ultimate way to get market price is to work for yourself, by\n\nstarting your own company.  That seems obvious to any ambitious\n\nperson now.  But in the mid 20th century it was an alien concept.\n\nNot because starting one's own company seemed too ambitious, but\n\nbecause it didn't seem ambitious enough. Even as late as the 1970s,\n\nwhen I grew up, the ambitious plan was to get lots of education at\n\nprestigious institutions, and then join some other prestigious\n\ninstitution and work one's way up the hierarchy.  Your prestige was\n\nthe prestige of the institution you belonged to.  People did start\n\ntheir own businesses of course, but educated people rarely did,\n\nbecause in those days there was practically zero concept of starting\n\nwhat we now call a startup:\n\na business that starts small and grows\n\nbig.  That was much harder to do in the mid 20th century.  Starting\n\none's own business meant starting a business that would start small\n\nand stay small. Which in those days of big companies often meant\n\nscurrying around trying to avoid being trampled by elephants.  It\n\nwas more prestigious to be one of the executive class riding the\n\nelephant.By the 1970s, no one stopped to wonder where the big prestigious\n\ncompanies had come from in the first place.  It seemed like they'd\n\nalways been there, like the chemical elements.  And indeed, there\n\nwas a double wall between ambitious kids in the 20th century and\n\nthe origins of the big companies.  Many of the big companies were\n\nroll-ups that didn't have clear founders.  And when they did, the\n\nfounders didn't seem like us.  Nearly all of them had been uneducated,\n\nin the sense of not having been to college.  They were what Shakespeare\n\ncalled rude mechanicals.  College trained one to be a member of the\n\nprofessional classes.  Its graduates didn't expect to do the sort\n\nof grubby menial work that Andrew Carnegie or Henry Ford started\n\nout doing.\n\n[15]And in the 20th century there were more and more college graduates.\n\nThey increased from about 2% of the population in 1900 to about 25%\n\nin 2000. In the middle of the century our two big forces intersect,\n\nin the form of the GI Bill, which sent 2.2 million World War II\n\nveterans to college.  Few thought of it in these terms, but the\n\nresult of making college the canonical path for the ambitious was\n\na world in which it was socially acceptable to work for Henry Ford,\n\nbut not to be Henry Ford.\n\n[16]I remember this world well. I came of age just as it was starting\n\nto break up. In my childhood it was still dominant. Not quite so\n\ndominant as it had been.  We could see from old TV shows and yearbooks\n\nand the way adults acted that people in the 1950s and 60s had been\n\neven more conformist than us.  The mid-century model was already\n\nstarting to get old. But that was not how we saw it at the time.\n\nWe would at most have said that one could be a bit more daring in\n\n1975 than 1965.  And indeed, things hadn't changed much yet.But change was coming soon. And when the Duplo economy started to\n\ndisintegrate, it disintegrated in several different ways at once.\n\nVertically integrated companies literally dis-integrated because\n\nit was more efficient to.  Incumbents faced new competitors as (a)\n\nmarkets went global and (b) technical innovation started to trump\n\neconomies of scale, turning size from an asset into a liability.\n\nSmaller companies were increasingly able to survive as formerly\n\nnarrow channels to consumers broadened.  Markets themselves started\n\nto change faster, as whole new categories of products appeared. And\n\nlast but not least, the federal government, which had previously\n\nsmiled upon J. P. Morgan's world as the natural state of things,\n\nbegan to realize it wasn't the last word after all.What J. P. Morgan was to the horizontal axis, Henry Ford was to the\n\nvertical.  He wanted to do everything himself. The giant plant he\n\nbuilt at River Rouge between 1917 and 1928 literally took in iron\n\nore at one end and sent cars out the other.  100,000 people worked\n\nthere. At the time it seemed the future. But that is not how car\n\ncompanies operate today.  Now much of the design and manufacturing\n\nhappens in a long supply chain, whose products the car companies\n\nultimately assemble and sell.  The reason car companies operate\n\nthis way is that it works better.  Each company in the supply chain\n\nfocuses on what they know best. And they each have to do it well\n\nor they can be swapped out for another supplier.Why didn't Henry Ford realize that networks of cooperating companies\n\nwork better than a single big company? One reason is that supplier\n\nnetworks take a while to evolve. In 1917, doing everything himself\n\nseemed to Ford the only way to get the scale he needed. And the\n\nsecond reason is that if you want to solve a problem using a network\n\nof cooperating companies, you have to be able to coordinate their\n\nefforts, and you can do that much better with computers.  Computers\n\nreduce the transaction costs that Coase argued are the raison d'etre\n\nof corporations. That is a fundamental change.In the early 20th century, big companies were synonymous with\n\nefficiency.  In the late 20th century they were synonymous with\n\ninefficiency.  To some extent this was because the companies\n\nthemselves had become sclerotic.  But it was also because our\n\nstandards were higher.It wasn't just within existing industries that change occurred.\n\nThe industries themselves changed.  It became possible to make lots\n\nof new things, and sometimes the existing companies weren't the\n\nones who did it best.Microcomputers are a classic example. The market was pioneered by\n\nupstarts like Apple. When it got big enough, IBM decided it was\n\nworth paying attention to.  At the time IBM completely dominated\n\nthe computer industry. They assumed that all they had to do, now\n\nthat this market was ripe, was to reach out and pick it.  Most\n\npeople at the time would have agreed with them.  But what happened\n\nnext illustrated how much more complicated the world had become.\n\nIBM did launch a microcomputer.  Though quite successful, it did\n\nnot crush Apple.  But even more importantly, IBM itself ended up\n\nbeing supplanted by a supplier coming in from the side — from\n\nsoftware, which didn't even seem to be the same business.  IBM's\n\nbig mistake was to accept a non-exclusive license for DOS.  It must\n\nhave seemed a safe move at the time.  No other computer manufacturer\n\nhad ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make if\n\nother manufacturers could offer DOS too?  The result of that\n\nmiscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones.  Microsoft\n\nnow owned the PC standard, and the customer.  And the microcomputer\n\nbusiness ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.Basically, Apple bumped IBM and then Microsoft stole its wallet.\n\nThat sort of thing did not happen to big companies in mid-century.\n\nBut it was going to happen increasingly often in the future.Change happened mostly by itself in the computer business.  In other\n\nindustries, legal obstacles had to be removed first.  Many of the\n\nmid-century oligopolies had been anointed by the federal government\n\nwith policies (and in wartime, large orders) that kept out competitors.\n\nThis didn't seem as dubious to government officials at the time as\n\nit sounds to us. They felt a two-party system ensured sufficient\n\ncompetition in politics.  It ought to work for business too.Gradually the government realized that anti-competitive policies\n\nwere doing more harm than good, and during the Carter administration\n\nit started to remove them. The word used for this process was\n\nmisleadingly narrow: deregulation.  What was really happening was\n\nde-oligopolization.  It happened to one industry after another.\n\nTwo of the most visible to consumers were air travel and long-distance\n\nphone service, which both became dramatically cheaper after\n\nderegulation.Deregulation also contributed to the wave of hostile takeovers in\n\nthe 1980s.  In the old days the only limit on the inefficiency of\n\ncompanies, short of actual bankruptcy, was the inefficiency of their\n\ncompetitors.  Now companies had to face absolute rather than relative\n\nstandards.  Any public company that didn't generate sufficient\n\nreturns on its assets risked having its management replaced with\n\none that would.  Often the new managers did this by breaking companies\n\nup into components that were more valuable separately.\n\n[17]Version 1 of the national economy consisted of a few big blocks\n\nwhose relationships were negotiated in back rooms by a handful of\n\nexecutives, politicians, regulators, and labor leaders.  Version 2\n\nwas higher resolution: there were more companies, of more different\n\nsizes, making more different things, and their relationships changed\n\nfaster. In this world there were still plenty of back room negotiations,\n\nbut more was left to market forces.  Which further accelerated the\n\nfragmentation.It's a little misleading to talk of versions when describing a\n\ngradual process, but not as misleading as it might seem.  There was\n\na lot of change in a few decades, and what we ended up with was\n\nqualitatively different.  The companies in the S&P 500 in 1958 had\n\nbeen there an average of 61 years. By 2012 that number was 18 years.\n\n[18]The breakup of the Duplo economy happened simultaneously with the\n\nspread of computing power. To what extent were computers a precondition?\n\nIt would take a book to answer that. Obviously the spread of computing\n\npower was a precondition for the rise of startups.  I suspect it\n\nwas for most of what happened in finance too.  But was it a\n\nprecondition for globalization or the LBO wave?  I don't know, but\n\nI wouldn't discount the possibility.  It may be that the refragmentation\n\nwas driven by computers in the way the industrial revolution was\n\ndriven by steam engines.  Whether or not computers were a precondition,\n\nthey have certainly accelerated it.The new fluidity of companies changed people's relationships with\n\ntheir employers. Why climb a corporate ladder that might be yanked\n\nout from under you?  Ambitious people started to think of a career\n\nless as climbing a single ladder than as a series of jobs that might\n\nbe at different companies. More movement (or even potential movement)\n\nbetween companies introduced more competition in salaries.  Plus\n\nas companies became smaller it became easier to estimate how much\n\nan employee contributed to the company's revenue.  Both changes\n\ndrove salaries toward market price. And since people vary dramatically\n\nin productivity, paying market price meant salaries started to\n\ndiverge.By no coincidence it was in the early 1980s that the term \"yuppie\"\n\nwas coined.  That word is not much used now, because the phenomenon\n\nit describes is so taken for granted, but at the time it was a label\n\nfor something novel. Yuppies were young professionals who made lots\n\nof money.  To someone in their twenties today, this wouldn't seem\n\nworth naming.  Why wouldn't young professionals make lots of money?\n\nBut until the 1980s, being underpaid early in your career was part\n\nof what it meant to be a professional.  Young professionals were\n\npaying their dues, working their way up the ladder.  The rewards\n\nwould come later.  What was novel about yuppies was that they wanted\n\nmarket price for the work they were doing now.The first yuppies did not work for startups. That was still in the\n\nfuture.  Nor did they work for big companies. They were professionals\n\nworking in fields like law, finance, and consulting.  But their example\n\nrapidly inspired their peers.  Once they saw that new BMW 325i, they\n\nwanted one too.Underpaying people at the beginning of their career only works if\n\neveryone does it. Once some employer breaks ranks, everyone else\n\nhas to, or they can't get good people.  And once started this process\n\nspreads through the whole economy, because at the beginnings of\n\npeople's careers they can easily switch not merely employers but\n\nindustries.But not all young professionals benefitted. You had to produce to\n\nget paid a lot.  It was no coincidence that the first yuppies worked\n\nin fields where it was easy to measure that.More generally, an idea was returning whose name sounds old-fashioned\n\nprecisely because it was so rare for so long: that you could make\n\nyour fortune.  As in the past there were multiple ways to do it.\n\nSome made their fortunes by creating wealth, and others by playing\n\nzero-sum games. But once it became possible to make one's fortune,\n\nthe ambitious had to decide whether or not to.  A physicist who\n\nchose physics over Wall Street in 1990 was making a sacrifice that\n\na physicist in 1960 didn't have to think about.The idea even flowed back into big companies.  CEOs of big companies\n\nmake more now than they used to, and I think much of the reason is\n\nprestige.  In 1960, corporate CEOs had immense prestige.  They were\n\nthe winners of the only economic game in town. But if they made as\n\nlittle now as they did then, in real dollar terms, they'd seem like\n\nsmall fry compared to professional athletes and whiz kids making\n\nmillions from startups and hedge funds. They don't like that idea,\n\nso now they try to get as much as they can, which is more than they\n\nhad been getting.\n\n[19]Meanwhile a similar fragmentation was happening at the other end\n\nof the economic scale.  As big companies' oligopolies became less\n\nsecure, they were less able to pass costs on to customers and thus\n\nless willing to overpay for labor.  And as the Duplo world of a few\n\nbig blocks fragmented into many companies of different sizes — some\n\nof them overseas — it became harder for unions to enforce their\n\nmonopolies.  As a result workers' wages also tended toward market\n\nprice. Which (inevitably, if unions had been doing their job) tended\n\nto be lower.  Perhaps dramatically so, if automation had decreased\n\nthe need for some kind of work.And just as the mid-century model induced social as well as economic\n\ncohesion, its breakup brought social as well as economic fragmentation.\n\nPeople started to dress and act differently.  Those who would later\n\nbe called the \"creative class\" became more mobile. People who didn't\n\ncare much for religion felt less pressure to go to church for\n\nappearances' sake, while those who liked it a lot opted for\n\nincreasingly colorful forms. Some switched from meat loaf to tofu,\n\nand others to Hot Pockets. Some switched from driving Ford sedans\n\nto driving small imported cars, and others to driving SUVs.  Kids\n\nwho went to private schools or wished they did started to dress\n\n\"preppy,\" and kids who wanted to seem rebellious made a conscious\n\neffort to look disreputable.  In a hundred ways people spread apart.\n\n[20]Almost four decades later, fragmentation is still increasing.  Has\n\nit been net good or bad?  I don't know; the question may be\n\nunanswerable.  Not entirely bad though.  We take for granted the\n\nforms of fragmentation we like, and worry only about the ones we\n\ndon't. But as someone who caught the tail end of mid-century\n\nconformism,\n\nI can tell you it was no utopia.\n\n[21]My goal here is not to say whether fragmentation has been good or\n\nbad, just to explain why it's happening.  With the centripetal\n\nforces of total war and 20th century oligopoly mostly gone, what\n\nwill happen next?  And more specifically, is it possible to reverse\n\nsome of the fragmentation we've seen?If it is, it will have to happen piecemeal.  You can't reproduce\n\nmid-century cohesion the way it was originally produced.  It would\n\nbe insane to go to war just to induce more national unity.  And\n\nonce you understand the degree to which the economic history of the\n\n20th century was a low-res version 1, it's clear you can't reproduce\n\nthat either.20th century cohesion was something that happened at least in a\n\nsense naturally.  The war was due mostly to external forces, and\n\nthe Duplo economy was an evolutionary phase.  If you want cohesion\n\nnow, you'd have to induce it deliberately.  And it's not obvious\n\nhow.  I suspect the best we'll be able to do is address the symptoms\n\nof fragmentation.  But that may be enough.The form of fragmentation people worry most about lately is economic inequality, and if you want to eliminate\n\nthat you're up against a truly formidable headwind that has\n\nbeen in operation since the stone age. Technology.Technology is\n\na lever. It magnifies work.  And the lever not only grows increasingly\n\nlong, but the rate at which it grows is itself increasing.Which in turn means the variation in the amount of wealth people\n\ncan create has not only been increasing, but accelerating.  The\n\nunusual conditions that prevailed in the mid 20th century masked\n\nthis underlying trend.  The ambitious had little choice but to join\n\nlarge organizations that made them march in step with lots of other\n\npeople — literally in the case of the armed forces, figuratively\n\nin the case of big corporations. Even if the big corporations had\n\nwanted to pay people proportionate to their value, they couldn't\n\nhave figured out how.  But that constraint has gone now.  Ever since\n\nit started to erode in the 1970s, we've seen the underlying forces\n\nat work again.\n\n[22]Not everyone who gets rich now does it by creating wealth, certainly.\n\nBut a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all their\n\npeers get dragged along too.\n\n[23]\n\nAnd as long as it's possible to\n\nget rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for\n\neconomic inequality to increase.  Even if you eliminate all the\n\nother ways to get rich.  You can mitigate this with subsidies at\n\nthe bottom and taxes at the top, but unless taxes are high enough\n\nto discourage people from creating wealth, you're always going to\n\nbe fighting a losing battle against increasing variation in\n\nproductivity.\n\n[24]That form of fragmentation, like the others, is here to stay.  Or\n\nrather, back to stay.  Nothing is forever, but the tendency toward\n\nfragmentation should be more forever than most things, precisely\n\nbecause it's not due to any particular cause.  It's simply a reversion\n\nto the mean. When Rockefeller said individualism was gone, he was\n\nright for a hundred years.  It's back now, and that's likely to be\n\ntrue for longer.I worry that if we don't acknowledge this, we're headed for trouble.\n\nIf we think 20th century cohesion disappeared because of few policy\n\ntweaks, we'll be deluded into thinking we can get it back (minus\n\nthe bad parts, somehow) with a few countertweaks.  And then we'll\n\nwaste our time trying to eliminate fragmentation, when we'd be\n\nbetter off thinking about how to mitigate its consequences.\n\nNotes[1]\n\nLester Thurow, writing in 1975, said the wage differentials\n\nprevailing at the end of World War II had become so embedded that\n\nthey \"were regarded as 'just' even after the egalitarian pressures\n\nof World War II had disappeared.  Basically, the same differentials\n\nexist to this day, thirty years later.\" But Goldin and Margo think\n\nmarket forces in the postwar period also helped preserve the wartime\n\ncompression of wages — specifically increased demand for unskilled\n\nworkers, and oversupply of educated ones.(Oddly enough, the American custom of having employers pay for\n\nhealth insurance derives from efforts by businesses to circumvent\n\nNWLB wage controls in order to attract workers.)[2]\n\nAs always, tax rates don't tell the whole story.  There were\n\nlots of exemptions, especially for individuals.  And in World War\n\nII the tax codes were so new that the government had little acquired\n\nimmunity to tax avoidance.  If the rich paid high taxes during the\n\nwar it was more because they wanted to than because they had to.After the war, federal tax receipts as a percentage of GDP were\n\nabout the same as they are now. In fact, for the entire period since\n\nthe war, tax receipts have stayed close to 18% of GDP, despite\n\ndramatic changes in tax rates.  The lowest point occurred when\n\nmarginal income tax rates were highest: 14.1% in 1950.  Looking at\n\nthe data, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that tax rates have had\n\nlittle effect on what people actually paid.[3]\n\nThough in fact the decade preceding the war had been a time\n\nof unprecedented federal power, in response to the Depression.\n\nWhich is not entirely a coincidence, because the Depression was one\n\nof the causes of the war.  In many ways the New Deal was a sort of\n\ndress rehearsal for the measures the federal government took during\n\nwartime.  The wartime versions were much more drastic and more\n\npervasive though.  As Anthony Badger wrote, \"for many Americans the\n\ndecisive change in their experiences came not with the New Deal but\n\nwith World War II.\"[4]\n\nI don't know enough about the origins of the world wars to\n\nsay, but it's not inconceivable they were connected to the rise of\n\nbig corporations. If that were the case, 20th century cohesion would\n\nhave a single cause.[5]\n\nMore precisely, there was a bimodal economy consisting, in\n\nGalbraith's words, of \"the world of the technically dynamic, massively\n\ncapitalized and highly organized corporations on the one hand and\n\nthe hundreds of thousands of small and traditional proprietors on\n\nthe other.\" Money, prestige, and power were concentrated in the\n\nformer, and there was near zero crossover.[6]\n\nI wonder how much of the decline in families eating together\n\nwas due to the decline in families watching TV together afterward.[7]\n\nI know when this happened because it was the season Dallas\n\npremiered.  Everyone else was talking about what was happening on\n\nDallas, and I had no idea what they meant.[8]\n\nI didn't realize it till I started doing research for this\n\nessay, but the meretriciousness of the products I grew up with is\n\na well-known byproduct of oligopoly. When companies can't compete\n\non price, they compete on tailfins.[9]\n\nMonroeville Mall was at the time of its completion in 1969\n\nthe largest in the country. In the late 1970s the movie Dawn of\n\nthe Dead was shot there. Apparently the mall was not just the\n\nlocation of the movie, but its inspiration; the crowds of shoppers\n\ndrifting through this huge mall reminded George Romero of zombies.\n\nMy first job was scooping ice cream in the Baskin-Robbins.[10]\n\nLabor unions were exempted from antitrust laws by the Clayton\n\nAntitrust Act in 1914 on the grounds that a person's work is not\n\n\"a commodity or article of commerce.\" I wonder if that means service\n\ncompanies are also exempt.[11]\n\nThe relationships between unions and unionized companies can\n\neven be symbiotic, because unions will exert political pressure to\n\nprotect their hosts.  According to Michael Lind, when politicians\n\ntried to attack the A&P supermarket chain because it was putting\n\nlocal grocery stores out of business, \"A&P successfully defended\n\nitself by allowing the unionization of its workforce in 1938, thereby\n\ngaining organized labor as a constituency.\" I've seen this phenomenon\n\nmyself: hotel unions are responsible for more of the political\n\npressure against Airbnb than hotel companies.[12]\n\nGalbraith was clearly puzzled that corporate executives would\n\nwork so hard to make money for other people (the shareholders)\n\ninstead of themselves.  He devoted much of The New Industrial\n\nState to trying to figure this out.His theory was that professionalism had replaced money as a motive,\n\nand that modern corporate executives were, like (good) scientists,\n\nmotivated less by financial rewards than by the desire to do good\n\nwork and thereby earn the respect of their peers.  There is something\n\nin this, though I think lack of movement between companies combined\n\nwith self-interest explains much of observed behavior.[13]\n\nGalbraith (p. 94) says a 1952 study of the 800 highest paid\n\nexecutives at 300 big corporations found that three quarters of\n\nthem had been with their company for more than 20 years.[14]\n\nIt seems likely that in the first third of the 20th century\n\nexecutive salaries were low partly because companies then were more\n\ndependent on banks, who would have disapproved if executives got\n\ntoo much.  This was certainly true in the beginning. The first big\n\ncompany CEOs were J. P. Morgan's hired hands.Companies didn't start to finance themselves with retained earnings\n\ntill the 1920s.  Till then they had to pay out their earnings in\n\ndividends, and so depended on banks for capital for expansion.\n\nBankers continued to sit on corporate boards till the Glass-Steagall\n\nact in 1933.By mid-century big companies funded 3/4 of their growth from earnings.\n\nBut the early years of bank dependence, reinforced by the financial\n\ncontrols of World War II, must have had a big effect on social\n\nconventions about executive salaries.  So it may be that the lack\n\nof movement between companies was as much the effect of low salaries\n\nas the cause.Incidentally, the switch in the 1920s to financing growth with\n\nretained earnings was one cause of the 1929 crash.  The banks now\n\nhad to find someone else to lend to, so they made more margin loans.[15]\n\nEven now it's hard to get them to. One of the things I find\n\nhardest to get into the heads of would-be startup founders is how\n\nimportant it is to do certain kinds of menial work early in the\n\nlife of a company.  Doing things that don't\n\nscale is to how Henry Ford got started as a high-fiber diet is\n\nto the traditional peasant's diet: they had no choice but to do the\n\nright thing, while we have to make a conscious effort.[16]\n\nFounders weren't celebrated in the press when I was a kid.\n\n\"Our founder\" meant a photograph of a severe-looking man with a\n\nwalrus mustache and a wing collar who had died decades ago. The\n\nthing to be when I was a kid was an executive. If you weren't\n\naround then it's hard to grasp the cachet that term had. The fancy\n\nversion of everything was called the \"executive\" model.[17]\n\nThe wave of hostile takeovers in the 1980s was enabled by a\n\ncombination of circumstances: court decisions striking down state\n\nanti-takeover laws, starting with the Supreme Court's 1982 decision\n\nin Edgar v. MITE Corp.; the Reagan administration's comparatively\n\nsympathetic attitude toward takeovers; the Depository Institutions\n\nAct of 1982, which allowed banks and savings and loans to buy\n\ncorporate bonds; a new SEC rule issued in 1982 (rule 415) that made\n\nit possible to bring corporate bonds to market faster; the creation\n\nof the junk bond business by Michael Milken; a vogue for conglomerates\n\nin the preceding period that caused many companies to be combined\n\nthat never should have been; a decade of inflation that left many\n\npublic companies trading below the value of their assets; and not\n\nleast, the increasing complacency of managements.[18]\n\nFoster, Richard. \"Creative Destruction Whips through Corporate\n\nAmerica.\" Innosight, February 2012.[19]\n\nCEOs of big companies may be overpaid. I don't know enough\n\nabout big companies to say. But it is certainly not impossible for\n\na CEO to make 200x as much difference to a company's revenues as\n\nthe average employee.  Look at what Steve Jobs did for Apple when\n\nhe came back as CEO.  It would have been a good deal for the board\n\nto give him 95% of the company.  Apple's market cap the day Steve\n\ncame back in July 1997 was 1.73 billion. 5% of Apple now (January\n\n2016) would be worth about 30 billion.  And it would not be if Steve\n\nhadn't come back; Apple probably wouldn't even exist anymore.Merely including Steve in the sample might be enough to answer the\n\nquestion of whether public company CEOs in the aggregate are overpaid.\n\nAnd that is not as facile a trick as it might seem, because the\n\nbroader your holdings, the more the aggregate is what you care\n\nabout.[20]\n\nThe late 1960s were famous for social upheaval. But that was\n\nmore rebellion (which can happen in any era if people are provoked\n\nsufficiently) than fragmentation.  You're not seeing fragmentation\n\nunless you see people breaking off to both left and right.[21]\n\nGlobally the trend has been in the other direction.  While\n\nthe US is becoming more fragmented, the world as a whole is becoming\n\nless fragmented, and mostly in good ways.[22]\n\nThere were a handful of ways to make a fortune in the mid\n\n20th century.  The main one was drilling for oil, which was open\n\nto newcomers because it was not something big companies could\n\ndominate through economies of scale.  How did individuals accumulate\n\nlarge fortunes in an era of such high taxes?  Giant tax loopholes\n\ndefended by two of the most powerful men in Congress, Sam Rayburn\n\nand Lyndon Johnson.But becoming a Texas oilman was not in 1950 something one could\n\naspire to the way starting a startup or going to work on Wall Street\n\nwere in 2000, because (a) there was a strong local component and\n\n(b) success depended so much on luck.[23]\n\nThe Baumol Effect induced by startups is very visible in\n\nSilicon Valley.  Google will pay people millions of dollars a year\n\nto keep them from leaving to start or join startups.[24]\n\nI'm not claiming variation in productivity is the only cause\n\nof economic inequality in the US. But it's a significant cause, and\n\nit will become as big a cause as it needs to, in the sense that if\n\nyou ban other ways to get rich, people who want to get rich will\n\nuse this route instead.Thanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Patrick\n\nCollison, Ron Conway, Chris Dixon, Benedict Evans, Richard Florida,\n\nBen Horowitz, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Tim O'Reilly, Geoff\n\nRalston, Max Roser, Alexia Tsotsis, and Qasar Younis for reading\n\ndrafts of this.

{"id": "jessica", "title": "Jessica Livingston", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/jessica.html", "date": null, "content": "November 2015A few months ago an article about Y Combinator said that early on\n\nit had been a \"one-man show.\"  It's sadly common to read that sort\n\nof thing.  But the problem with that description is not just that\n\nit's unfair.  It's also misleading.  Much of what's most novel about\n\nYC is due to Jessica Livingston.  If you don't understand her, you\n\ndon't understand YC.  So let me tell you a little about Jessica.YC had 4 founders.  Jessica and I decided one night to start it,\n\nand the next day we recruited my friends Robert Morris and Trevor\n\nBlackwell.  Jessica and I ran YC day to day, and Robert and Trevor\n\nread applications and did interviews with us.Jessica and I were already dating when we started YC.  At first we\n\ntried to act \"professional\" about this, meaning we tried to conceal\n\nit.  In retrospect that seems ridiculous, and we soon dropped the\n\npretense.  And the fact that Jessica and I were a couple is a big\n\npart of what made YC what it was.  YC felt like a family.  The\n\nfounders early on were mostly young.  We all had dinner together\n\nonce a week, cooked for the first couple years by me. Our first\n\nbuilding had been a private home.  The overall atmosphere was\n\nshockingly different from a VC's office on Sand Hill Road, in a way\n\nthat was entirely for the better.  There was an authenticity that\n\neveryone who walked in could sense.  And that didn't just mean that\n\npeople trusted us.  It was the perfect quality to instill in startups.\n\nAuthenticity is one of the most important things YC looks for in\n\nfounders, not just because fakers and opportunists are annoying,\n\nbut because authenticity is one of the main things that separates\n\nthe most successful startups from the rest.Early YC was a family, and Jessica was its mom.  And the culture\n\nshe defined was one of YC's most important innovations.  Culture\n\nis important in any organization, but at YC culture wasn't just how\n\nwe behaved when we built the product. At YC, the culture was the\n\nproduct.Jessica was also the mom in another sense: she had the last word.\n\nEverything we did as an organization went through her first — who\n\nto fund, what to say to the public, how to deal with other companies,\n\nwho to hire, everything.Before we had kids, YC was more or less our life. There was no real\n\ndistinction between working hours and not.  We talked about YC all\n\nthe time.  And while there might be some businesses that it would\n\nbe tedious to let infect your private life, we liked it. We'd started\n\nYC because it was something we were interested in.  And some of the\n\nproblems we were trying to solve were endlessly difficult.  How do\n\nyou recognize good founders?  You could talk about that for years,\n\nand we did; we still do.I'm better at some things than Jessica, and she's better at some\n\nthings than me.  One of the things she's best at is judging people.\n\nShe's one of those rare individuals with x-ray vision for character.\n\nShe can see through any kind of faker almost immediately.  Her\n\nnickname within YC was the Social Radar, and this special power of\n\nhers was critical in making YC what it is.  The earlier you pick\n\nstartups, the more you're picking the founders.  Later stage investors\n\nget to try products and look at growth numbers.  At the stage where\n\nYC invests, there is often neither a product nor any numbers.Others thought YC had some special insight about the future of\n\ntechnology.  Mostly we had the same sort of insight Socrates claimed:\n\nwe at least knew we knew nothing.  What made YC successful was being\n\nable to pick good founders.  We thought Airbnb was a bad idea.  We\n\nfunded it because we liked the founders.During interviews, Robert and Trevor and I would pepper the applicants\n\nwith technical questions.  Jessica would mostly watch.  A lot of\n\nthe applicants probably read her as some kind of secretary, especially\n\nearly on, because she was the one who'd go out and get each new\n\ngroup and she didn't ask many questions. She was ok with that.  It\n\nwas easier for her to watch people if they didn't notice her. But\n\nafter the interview, the three of us would turn to Jessica and ask\n\n\"What does the Social Radar say?\"\n\n[1]Having the Social Radar at interviews wasn't just how we picked\n\nfounders who'd be successful.  It was also how we picked founders\n\nwho were good people.  At first we did this because we couldn't\n\nhelp it.  Imagine what it would feel like to have x-ray vision for\n\ncharacter.  Being around bad people would be intolerable.  So we'd\n\nrefuse to fund founders whose characters we had doubts about even\n\nif we thought they'd be successful.Though we initially did this out of self-indulgence, it turned out\n\nto be very valuable to YC.  We didn't realize it in the beginning,\n\nbut the people we were picking would become the YC alumni network.\n\nAnd once we picked them, unless they did something really egregious,\n\nthey were going to be part of it for life. Some now think YC's\n\nalumni network is its most valuable feature. I personally think\n\nYC's advice is pretty good too, but the alumni network is certainly\n\namong the most valuable features.  The level of trust and helpfulness\n\nis remarkable for a group of such size.  And Jessica is the main\n\nreason why.(As we later learned, it probably cost us little to reject people\n\nwhose characters we had doubts about, because how good founders are\n\nand how well they do are not orthogonal.  If bad founders succeed\n\nat all, they tend to sell early.  The most successful founders are\n\nalmost all good.)If Jessica was so important to YC, why don't more people realize\n\nit?  Partly because I'm a writer, and writers always get disproportionate\n\nattention.  YC's brand was initially my brand, and our applicants\n\nwere people who'd read my essays.  But there is another reason:\n\nJessica hates attention.  Talking to reporters makes her nervous.\n\nThe thought of giving a talk paralyzes her.  She was even uncomfortable\n\nat our wedding, because the bride is always the center of attention.\n\n[2]It's not just because she's shy that she hates attention, but because\n\nit throws off the Social Radar. She can't be herself. You can't\n\nwatch people when everyone is watching you.Another reason attention worries her is that she hates bragging.\n\nIn anything she does that's publicly visible, her biggest fear\n\n(after the obvious fear that it will be bad) is that it will seem\n\nostentatious.  She says being too modest is a common problem for\n\nwomen.  But in her case it goes beyond that.  She has a horror of\n\nostentation so visceral it's almost a phobia.She also hates fighting. She can't do it; she just shuts down.  And\n\nunfortunately there is a good deal of fighting in being the public\n\nface of an organization.So although Jessica more than anyone made YC unique, the very\n\nqualities that enabled her to do it mean she tends to get written\n\nout of YC's history.  Everyone buys this story that PG started YC\n\nand his wife just kind of helped.  Even YC's haters buy it.  A\n\ncouple years ago when people were attacking us for not funding more\n\nfemale founders (than exist), they all treated YC as identical with\n\nPG.  It would have spoiled the narrative to acknowledge Jessica's\n\ncentral role at YC.Jessica was boiling mad that people were accusing her company of\n\nsexism. I've never seen her angrier about anything.  But she did\n\nnot contradict them.  Not publicly.  In private there was a great\n\ndeal of profanity.  And she wrote three separate essays about the\n\nquestion of female founders.  But she could never bring herself to\n\npublish any of them.  She'd seen the level of vitriol in this debate,\n\nand she shrank from engaging.\n\n[3]It wasn't just because she disliked fighting.  She's so sensitive\n\nto character that it repels her even to fight with dishonest people.\n\nThe idea of mixing it up with linkbait journalists or Twitter trolls\n\nwould seem to her not merely frightening, but disgusting.But Jessica knew her example as a successful female founder would\n\nencourage more women to start companies, so last year she did\n\nsomething YC had never done before and hired a PR firm to get her\n\nsome interviews.  At one of the first she did, the reporter brushed\n\naside her insights about startups and turned it into a sensationalistic\n\nstory about how some guy had tried to chat her up as she was waiting\n\noutside the bar where they had arranged to meet.  Jessica was\n\nmortified, partly because the guy had done nothing wrong, but more\n\nbecause the story treated her as a victim significant only for being\n\na woman, rather than one of the most knowledgeable investors in the\n\nValley.After that she told the PR firm to stop.You're not going to be hearing in the press about what Jessica has\n\nachieved. So let me tell you what Jessica has achieved.  Y Combinator\n\nis fundamentally a nexus of people, like a university. It doesn't\n\nmake a product. What defines it is the people.  Jessica more than\n\nanyone curated and nurtured that collection of people.  In that\n\nsense she literally made YC.Jessica knows more about the qualities of startup founders than\n\nanyone else ever has. Her immense data set and x-ray vision are the\n\nperfect storm in that respect.  The qualities of the founders are\n\nthe best predictor of how a startup will do.  And startups are in\n\nturn the most important source of growth in mature economies.The person who knows the most about the most important factor in\n\nthe growth of mature economies — that is who Jessica Livingston is.\n\nDoesn't that sound like someone who should be better known?Notes[1]\n\nHarj Taggar reminded me that while Jessica didn't ask many\n\nquestions, they tended to be important ones:\"She was always good at sniffing out any red flags about the team\n\nor their determination and disarmingly asking the right question,\n\nwhich usually revealed more than the founders realized.\"[2]\n\nOr more precisely, while she likes getting attention in the\n\nsense of getting credit for what she has done, she doesn't like\n\ngetting attention in the sense of being watched in real time.\n\nUnfortunately, not just for her but for a lot of people, how much\n\nyou get of the former depends a lot on how much you get of the\n\nlatter.Incidentally, if you saw Jessica at a public event, you would never\n\nguess she\n\nhates attention, because (a) she is very polite and (b) when she's\n\nnervous, she expresses it by smiling more.[3]\n\nThe existence of people like Jessica is not just something\n\nthe mainstream media needs to learn to acknowledge, but something\n\nfeminists need to learn to acknowledge as well.  There are successful\n\nwomen who don't like to fight.  Which means if the public conversation\n\nabout women consists of fighting, their voices will be silenced.There's a sort of Gresham's Law of conversations. If a conversation\n\nreaches a certain level of incivility, the more thoughtful people\n\nstart to leave. No one understands female founders better than\n\nJessica.  But it's unlikely anyone will ever hear her speak candidly\n\nabout the topic. She ventured a toe in that water a while ago, and\n\nthe reaction was so violent that she decided \"never again.\"", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 1899, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:56.073783Z"}
{"id": "bias", "title": "A Way to Detect Bias", "url": "http://paulgraham.com/bias.html", "date": null, "content": "October 2015This will come as a surprise to a lot of people, but in some cases\n\nit's possible to detect bias in a selection process without knowing\n\nanything about the applicant pool.  Which is exciting because among\n\nother things it means third parties can use this technique to detect\n\nbias whether those doing the selecting want them to or not.You can use this technique whenever (a) you have at least\n\na random sample of the applicants that were selected, (b) their\n\nsubsequent performance is measured, and (c) the groups of\n\napplicants you're comparing have roughly equal distribution of ability.How does it work?  Think about what it means to be biased.  What\n\nit means for a selection process to be biased against applicants\n\nof type x is that it's harder for them to make it through.  Which\n\nmeans applicants of type x have to be better to get selected than\n\napplicants not of type x.\n\n[1]\n\nWhich means applicants of type x\n\nwho do make it through the selection process will outperform other\n\nsuccessful applicants.  And if the performance of all the successful\n\napplicants is measured, you'll know if they do.Of course, the test you use to measure performance must be a valid\n\none.  And in particular it must not be invalidated by the bias you're\n\ntrying to measure.\n\nBut there are some domains where performance can be measured, and\n\nin those detecting bias is straightforward. Want to know if the\n\nselection process was biased against some type of applicant?  Check\n\nwhether they outperform the others.  This is not just a heuristic\n\nfor detecting bias.  It's what bias means.For example, many suspect that venture capital firms are biased\n\nagainst female founders. This would be easy to detect: among their\n\nportfolio companies, do startups with female founders outperform\n\nthose without?  A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly\n\nunintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. First\n\nRound Capital found that among its portfolio companies, startups\n\nwith female founders outperformed\n\nthose without by 63%.\n\n[2]The reason I began by saying that this technique would come as a\n\nsurprise to many people is that we so rarely see analyses of this\n\ntype.  I'm sure it will come as a surprise to First Round that they\n\nperformed one. I doubt anyone there realized that by limiting their\n\nsample to their own portfolio, they were producing a study not of\n\nstartup trends but of their own biases when selecting companies.I predict we'll see this technique used more in the future.  The\n\ninformation needed to conduct such studies is increasingly available.\n\nData about who applies for things is usually closely guarded by the\n\norganizations selecting them, but nowadays data about who gets\n\nselected is often publicly available to anyone who takes the trouble\n\nto aggregate it.\n\nNotes[1]\n\nThis technique wouldn't work if the selection process looked\n\nfor different things from different types of applicants—for\n\nexample, if an employer hired men based on their ability but women\n\nbased on their appearance.[2]\n\nAs Paul Buchheit points out, First Round excluded their most\n\nsuccessful investment, Uber, from the study.  And while it\n\nmakes sense to exclude outliers from some types of studies,\n\nstudies of returns from startup investing, which is all about\n\nhitting outliers, are not one of them.", "footnotes": [], "word_count": 542, "scraped_at": "2025-11-17T11:17:56.657642Z"}
